9,2006,"1. outreach program the secretary mandates that an outreach program be established by all veterans affairs administrations and appropriate staff offices to reach out and support all veterans. as a minimum, the program must incorporate the following goals activities a. inclusion of and coordination with local, federal and state veteran serving organizations in va facilities outreach activities. these entities should include, as a minimum, state and county veterans affairs agencies, veteran service organizations vsos , veteran serving organizations i.e. minority veterans organizations that have not been granted vso status , agencies and organizations that serve the minority community in the local area, faith based organizations that serve veterans, etc.; b. establishment of periodic veteran town hall meetings with veterans and their families to determine needs and issues; meetings processes must ensure that minority veterans and communities are targeted in culturally appropriate venues; c. allow facilities to advertise veteran benefits and healthcare services and consult marketing experts to help va facilities conduct effective communication of va offerings with particular attention to marketing to minority communities; d. expand and improve the use of internet based access to va benefits and healthcare, with particular attention given to cultural and linguistic diversity; e. establish minority outreach coordinators that are full time, where warranted. further recommend that these be additional billets that are fully resourced for those facilities, rather than requiring facility directors to give up other billets to fill those positions; f. mandate enhanced outreach communication and coordination between vha, vba, nca and appropriate staff offices; g. identify federal grants for states to conduct grassroots outreach programs.&&2. marketing a current ban on marketing established by an assistant secretary of vha was brought to the attention of the committee several times during its site visit. this policy is currently interpreted by the field as a ban on all outreach programs especially to minority veteran populations. the committee views the application of this policy as a serious impediment to minority veterans knowledge of their va 20 benefits and va healthcare entitlements. the repeal or redefining of the dva policy prohibiting marketing needs to be immediately disseminated to all dva field facilities. the committee was led to believe that the memorandum establishing the ban on marketing had been formally rescinded. if this is correct, it is vital that all facilities be advised that outreach to minority veteran populations is encouraged and expected. the committee desires a brief on the efforts taken by dva leadership addressing this contentious issue at its next washington dc committee meeting.&&3. research programs dva design, develop and fund research agendas focusing on minority veteran issues to include but not limited to a. identification of racial ethnic health disparities; b. identification of barriers that prevent minority veterans from accessing and using their veteran benefits and healthcare services; c. identification of what culturally appropriate practices would support greater participation in va benefits and services by minority veterans; va must endeavor to coordinate and disseminate the results of such research to audiences both within dva practicing healthcare givers, vba and nca employees as well as providing briefings of findings to vsos, minority community leaders, state and county veterans officers, etc. the goal is to inform minority veterans and those entities serving the minority community of potential barriers to access so that appropriate measuresmonthbe taken to eliminate the barriers.&&4. coordination care home telehealth ccht va aggressively implements the ccht program in rural communities where veterans, and especially minority veterans, are at greatest risk of not being able to receive appropriate and timely va healthcare i.e., south texas, alaska, montana, samoa, etc. the committee noted in particular the coordination care home telehealth ccht program in los angeles that would have broad implications for minority veteran health if aggressively utilized throughout the country.&&5. veteran centers a comprehensive briefing on rehabilitation counseling services be given the committee at its next committee meeting in washington dc. the purpose is to fully explain the functions of the veterans centers and their interaction with dvas health facilities, concerning minority veterans. 21.&&6. land use policies va should conduct a review of land use policies within the agency, to allow va facility directors greater latitude in generating revenue to execute their mission. greater local flexibility to make business decisions would result in more funds for ancillary programs such as those that address outreach to minority veterans and homeless veteran populations. because of the impact of cares on this issue, the committee requests an update on cares at it next washington d.c. meeting.&&7. staff diversity staff diversity at the los angeles va facilities was not representative of the minority veteran population especially with regard to the higher pay grades and for african americans, hispanics and american indians. this appears to be a systemic issue throughout the department of veterans affairs dva . the committee recommends that dva a. develop a targeted recruitment plan for minority hiring at all levels of the department across the country; b. dva design, implement and fully resource cultural sensitivity training programs for all dva employees and make it mandatory; c. dva direct the compilation of ethnic racial data of its employee population and the veteran population in all its data gathering processes; d. provide a brief at the committees next washington d.c. meeting on the progress made concerning this issue.&&8. impact of local economy on budget in formulating its budget for facilities, there must consideration of the local economy and its impact. facilities annual budgets should include adjustments for the cost of living in the local economy. proper resourcing of employee payrolls, incentive pay and retention pay need to reflect the economic realities of the facility location. i.e. the cost of housing in los angeles makes recruitment of lower pay grade employees almost impossible and impacts minority hiring because they tend to be in the lower pay grades. as a minimum the committee recommends a. dva establish processes to insure that resourcing of facility budgets consider their location, cost of living, and recruitment retention cost requirements;
