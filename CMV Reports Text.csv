Statement of the Chairman, Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans

Pursuant to Section 510, Public Law 103-446, this Second Annual Report to the
United States Congress through the Secretary of Veterans Affairs describes the actions
taken by the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to accomplish its objectives for
fiscal year 1996.

The Committee is charged by the United States Congress and the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs with providing advice and consultation to the Congress and the Secretary
of Veterans Affairs on the needs and concerns of minority veterans with respect to the
administration of veterans’ benefits and services. ,

This mandate resulted in the Committee's initial meeting in June 1995 that led to our
first annual report for fiscal year 1995 which outlined the Committee's goals in getting to
the business of substantive advice and consultation in direct support of the welfare of our
minority veterans. Despite having only four months remaining in the fiscal year, the
Committee's deliberations led to the design of a thoughtful strategy and operational plan,
as well as high expectations, for fiscal year 1996.

, The first full year of the Committee was a period of challenge that required dedicated
effort by every member in order to sustain our solid start. Despite difficult budgetary
constraints on the Committee, the members made genuine contributions in their —
Subcommittees and across a wide front of minority veterans’ concerns.

The Subcommittee on Health Care; the Subcommittee on Labor, Employment and
Transition, the Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation; and the Subcommittee on
Outreach and Rehabilitation accomplished much of their work by members contributing
their time and resources to do independent research, small group visits, and individual
assessments Their efforts and reports constitute the substantive portion of this Second
Annual Report.

Individual members also took time from their business trips to attend to Subcommittee
requirements, participated in meetings and conferences with veterans service and
community minority organizations to gain critical insights, and called on Congressional
and Deparment of Veterans Affairs leaders to share the Committee's findings and to ,
explain the Committee's goals and purposes in serving ail our minority veterans. Their
valuable input has been incorporated throughout this report.

4,"A great many people throughout the Congress of the United States and the Department
of Veterans Affairs have welcomed the initiatives of the Committee in meeting the unique
needs of minority veterans and have provided thoughtful assistance in bringing people

together to illuminate and remove the barriers to dignified service to minority veterans.

Finally, this report captures the process and the actions of the Committee and clearly
suggests that while it would have been preferable to have been funded properly,
nevertheless, the hard work and commitment of the members, in concert with the Center
for Minority Veterans, led to genuine partnerships and effective collaborations with
minority organizations, veterans service organizations, community leaders, the Department
of Veterans Affairs, and those whom we serve, our minority veterans.

We complete our first year with a stronger belief in the wisdom that created Public
Law 103-446 and an eagerness to continue our challenge of advising the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs and the Congress of the United States on the needs and concerns of
minority veterans with respect to the admunistration of veterans' benefits and services.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Second Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans describes

the fiscal challenge faced by the Committee and the alternative solutions created in

, partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs to move forward substantively on the
operational plans developed by the four Subcommittees during the Committee's September
1995 meeting.

Fiscal year 1995 ended with a commitment by the Committee to make a difference in
providing advice and consultation to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Congress of :
the United States on the needs and concerns of minority veterans with respect to the
administration of veterans' benefits and services.

Fiscal year 1996, however, was both a story of struggle and a story of success, a
period of missed opportunities and a period of creative solutions, and a cycle of collective
frustrations and a cycle of individual contributions.

This report outlines the progress of the Committee, specific accomplishments, and
findings which are informed by the concerns of the Committee, some of which are:

-inadequate and tnsufficient research in health care, compensation and benefits for
minority veterans

- insufficient ethnic representation on both the Rating Panels and the Merit Review
Boards

-lack of genuine service and outreach programs to minority veterans living in rural
areas, pacific islands, or reservations

-elimination or modification of Department or Regional programs without
sufficient input or genuine consideration of minority veterans' needs

-absence of minority advisory committees empowered to provide direct :
information and advice to Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Directors and
Regional Directors on the needs and concerns of minority veterans

-Inadequate process to pursue aggressively alternative solutions to increase access
to health services

-lack of definitive policies and sustaining efforts to educate VA staff regarding
exceptional Customer service appropniate to minority cultures

-absence of ethnic identifiers on VA's initial application forms

-exciusion of veterans preference status in Part C, Title IV, Job Training
Partnership Act
",0,0,0,0
7,"-absence of aggressive programs that take care of homeless minority veterans and
provide hope, as well as properly correct cultural treatment, for minority veterans
suffering from alcohol and drug dependencies

Each of the four Subcommittees - Health Care; Benefits and Compensation; Labor,
Employment and Transition; and Outreach and Rehabilitation - report on the status of
their efforts to achieve their operational plans. Without any resources the entire fiscal
year, their planned dual strategy of regional work shops and conferences followed by
reports to the full Committee could not be instituted.

Yet, there were success stones that are reflected throughout this report.

Finally, the report concludes with sixteen specific recommendations to the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs, some of the recommendations requiring action by the United States
Congress.

The Committee conducted its last session, September 17-21, 1995, at the Department
of Veterans Affairs, Washington, DC. During this meeting each Subcommittee confirmed
its definitive operational plan with specific goals and objectives for fiscal year 1996.

Discussions with Deputy Secretary Hershel W. Gober, Under Secretary R. John Vogel,
and Chief of Staff Harold F. Gracey, Jr., confirmed their support of the Committee's goals,
objectives and its fiscal year 1996 operational plan but suggested the possibility of funding
restrictions. This became evident as the Committee planned for a February, then March,
and then a June meeting, none of which materialized.

The impact of minimal travel, per diem, and support funding also limited the Center for
Minority Veterans in starting and gaining the momentum in 1996 and in building a
communication network among the various national and local organizations, as well as
federal agencies, that could provide advice and information regarding the administration of
minority veterans' benefits and services. |
B. GENERAL

The Subcommittees based their pian on three factors: one, regional work conferences
at the most appropnate sites; two, reports to the full Committee during the twice-a-year
meetings, and three, being funded. None of the three was accomplished.

While the Committee had been unable to undertake its operational plan for fiscal year

1996 because of funding constraints, even after thoughtful suggestions by VA's leadership,
we nevertheless succeeded in accomplishing specific objectives using alternative methods.

It is not without regret that the Committee concludes what could have been a very
productive work year. The collective belief of each member of the Committee is that
while we lament not being able to do more, we are not disappointed in the process nor in
the promise of fulfilling 1996's strategy and plan in fiscal year 1997. |

The process that has been started should not, and cannot, be turned away.
Already minority veterans are unanimous in their judgment in the wisdom of the United

States Congress in establishing the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans and the
Center for Minority Veterans. They, too, share the President's vision of a government that
looks like and represents all of America, a Department of Veterans Affairs that takes a
direct and personal interest in the welfare of all veterans equally, and civil servants whose
commitment and skills selflessly serve the heroes and heroines who sacrificed themselves
to serve their country. They, our minority veterans, are the reason that informs the
judgment and wisdom of the United States Congress; we exist to serve them.

They can be unanimous, also, in their disappointment should their expectations of the
Committee and Center end in underachievements, marginalization, or subpar efforts.

The details that follow outline the thirteen major accomplishments of the Committee; a
summary of the Subcommittees’ reports; nine key findings and sixteen recommendations
for action based on the work of the members and Subcommittees; and seven annexes as
references as indicated in the Table of Contents.

C. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS

First, the outlook for instructive engagement of the issues and concerns facing minority
veterans was positive, particularly with the collaborative study hosted by The Honorable |
Preston M. Taylor, Jr., Assistant Secretary, Veterans' Employment and Training, US
Department of Labor. Having briefed the Committee on the study's purpose to conduct
focus group dialogues with employers and veterans, he offered the Committee the
opportunity to review the approach of the study. The Vice Chairwoman of the Committee
provided significant input to the structure of the study effort, and her recommendations
were incorporated into the study. Because of the importance of both the study and the
collaborative partnership, enclosed at Appendix | 1s a copy of the study.

Second, on the final day of the Committee's session, the Subcommittee on Health
reported that a decision was to be reached very soon on the selection of the twenty-two
VISN Directors The members recommended we advise Secretary Jesse Brown and Dr.
Kenneth Kizer, Under Secretary for Health, that they ought to review the selection
process to imsure that the widest net possible was cast for qualified minority applicants. __
Tlus timely and sensitive suggestion was genuinely received by the Secretary and Dr.

Kizer and led to their validation of the Department's appropriate selection criteria, process
and the final appointments of the twenty-two VISN Directors.

10,"Third, based on the Subcommittee on Health's deliberations during the Committee's
September meeting, a letter dated September 28, 1995 was sent to Secretary Jesse Brown
requesting a sensitivity reassessment on the selection process for the twenty-two VISN
Directors. The Undersecretary for Health, Dr. Kenneth Kizer, responded in a positive
letter dated November 30, 1995. See Annex G.

Fourth, a letter report was forwarded to Secretary Jesse Brown detailing the
suggestions offered in an exit briefing by two members of the Committee resulting from a
visit to the Seattle's VA Regional Office on October 23-24, 1995. Eleven specific issues

, and concerns are outlined as a separate enclosure to the letter report. See Annex G.

Fifth, again based on the Subcommittees’ work sessions during the Committee's
September meeting, a November 15, 1995, letter was forwarded to Secretary Jesse Brown
outlining potential areas of examination that could improve the admimustration of veterans’
benefits and services. The areas were the composition of Rating Panels, the composition
of Merit Review Boards, the prioritization of effort to data collection/survey/research and
studies on all ethnic minority veterans, and the capabilities of the Center for Minonty
Veterans. Both the transmittal letter and the Secretary's response are at Annex G.

Sixth, a member of the Committee attended the celebration of the Japanese American
Veterans Memorial in Los Angeles and met with Japanese American veterans leaders.

Seventh, members took time from their business trips to visit with minority veterans
across the country to listen to their needs and concerns. The Center for Minority Veterans
assisted in these visits by providing the names, addresses, and phone numbers of the
minority veteran leaders. Written reports were not requested; rather, oral discussions of _
these meetings with the Director and staff, Center for Minority Veterans, was encouraged.

Eighth, members of the Committee met with members of Congress and their principal
legislative assistants to explain the Committee's purposes and goals; provide a copy of the
Committee's first annual report; describe the composition of the Committee, share the

Committee's concems regarding its tenure, budget restrictions, lack of meaningful research
data on all minority veteran's ethnic groups, and emphasize both the wisdom of the
Conuress in passing Public Law 103-446 and the expectations of our minority veterans.
Among those visited were Representative Bob Stump, Chairman of the House Committee :
on Veterans Affairs, and Car! D. Commenator, Chief Counsel and Staff Director.
Representative Lane Evans; Representative Bob Filner and his legislative assistant, Sharon
schultz, Representative Luts Gutierrez and legislative assistants Mark Fine and Bill
Weinberg, Representative Corrine Brown's legislative assistant, Gail Ravnitzky,
Representative Patsy Mink; Representative Eni Faleomavaega; Ms. Suzie Glucksman,
levisiatve assistant to Representative Joe Kennedy; and Senator John D. Rockefeller's
Minority Chief Counsel and Staff Director, Jim Gottlieb, and Minority General Counsel,

Affairs, to include Hershel Gober, Deputy Secretary; R. John Vogel, Under Secretary for
Benefits: Dr. Kenneth Kizer, Under Secretary for Health; Harold F. Gracey, Jr., Chief of
Staff, Alfonso R. Batres, Director, Readjustment and Counseling Services; and Ed Scott,
Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs, to discuss the need for an institutionalized
research program to provide accurate data on minonity veterans; the need to share
consistently and openly with the Committee and Center those significant Departmental
changes being contemplated; the importance of visible and genuine support by the
leadership for systemic changes that will improve the quality of service provided to
minority veterans; funding support for the Committee; and support for additional full time
personne] for the Center.

Tenth, members of the Committee, acting in the capacity of facilitators, have shared
individual minority veteran issues, problems, and concerns with the Center for Minority
Veterans. This has created a positive, closer working relationship among the Director, his
staff and the members and resulted in some successes. The Center has compiled a listing
of concerns advanced by Committee members on behalf of individual minority veterans. A
copy of these concems can be provided by the Center.

Eleventh, the Chairman, Vice Chairwoman, and the four Chairs of the Subcommittees
met in a one day working session in February in Washington, DC, to discuss the status of
the Committee's work, review the progress of the Subcommittees, reassess the operational
plans in light of the funding constraints, and establish revised objectives for each
Subcommittee. This meeting was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Twelfih, a member of the Committee presented testimony on March 27, 1996, before
the Joint Committee on Veterans Affairs on behalf of Navajo veterans; discussed a one-
stop Vet Center on the Navajo Nation and the importance of establishing a Vet Center in
Chinle, Navajo Nation with the key DVA leaders on March 29, 1996; and on May 10,
[996 he provided testimony before the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent

Agencies regarding the FY 1997 Budget Proposal for the Department of Veterans Affairs,
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. An
outline of the data and testimony 1s at Annex F.

Thineenth, a member of the Committee was an active participant, facilitator and leader
across a wide range of organizations and focus groups involving the needs and issues of
minority veterans He was a participant at the 54th World Veterans Federation Executive
Council meeting in Morocco in 1995 and the World Veterans Federation 9th Standing
Committee on African Affairs in Ghana in 1996, speaker at the National Coalition for
Hiomeless Veterans in Washington, DC; panel moderator at the Chicago Homeless
Veterans Conterence, and Cochair of the Veterans Committee for the National
Association of Black Social Workers. A summary outline is at Annex F.

member of the Committee in carrying out their duties and responsibilities created a
synergy that accounted for the successes accomplished this fiscal year.

D. SUMMARY OF SUBCOMMITTEES' REPORTS
A brief summary of each Subcommittee's report ts outlined below:
1. Subcommittee on Health Care (See Annex B)

The Subcommittee developed a strategic plan during the September 1995 meeting 7
to achieve the goals and objectives outlined in the Committee's First Annual Report. The
following health care needs and issues were identified for action:

a. Ensure cultural sensitivity and awareness in the delivery of health care, An
important step was taken in this regard in the transmittal of the Committee's letter to the
Secretary dated September 28, 1995. See Annex G.

b. Ensure that health care services are accessible to minority veterans through
decentralization, improved transportation for minority veterans, use of alternative health
care services, and sharing working agreements with the Indian Health Services.

c. Ensure appropriation of research resources to minority veterans by ethnic
groups which may be statistically small but significant.

d. Incorporation of alternative healing practices of Native Americans, Asian
Americans, Pacific Americans, and Hispanic Americans into the medical practices
authorized by VA.

e Amendment of Public Law 103-446, Section 5125, to permit the acceptance of
reports or evaluations conducted by the Indian Health Service for the purposes of
establishing any compensation or pension claim, including the original compensation claim.

! Review and incorporation of models of minority health care delivery systems that
work within the VA medical services accorded for minority veterans.

2. Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation (See Annex C)

This Subcommittee began to develop a working plan at the September 1995

meetin Major activities included:

13,"a a
a, Three members of the group visited a Washington, DC, Outreach Clinic,
discussed minority veterans needs and concerns with the staff, and gained valuable insights

in the strength of such clinics, particularly in reaching out to the minority veterans.

b. Based on our September 1995 meeting, a letter was forwarded to the Secretary ,
regarding ethnic representation on the Rating Panels and Merit Review Boards. See
Annex G.

c. Public Law 102-547, Native American Veterans Direct Home Loan Program,
expires in September 1997. Recent statistics compiled by the Center for Minority
Veterans clearly suggest that it is a success and must be extended for an indefinite period.

d. Native American veterans continue to have the most pressing service needs,
such as counseling, benefit claims, health care services, and dissemination of veteran
information. Establishment of community-based Vet Centers on Native American
reservations or trust lands would be an excellent solution.

e. Title 38, U.S.C., Section 2408 should be amended to allow tnbal governments
the authority for grants-in-aid for the purposes of establishing, expanding or improving
Native American cemeteries on tribal or trust lands.

f. Consistent with the findings of the Subcommittees on Health Care; Outreach and
Rehabilitation; and Labor benefits and compensation counselors should be representative
of the veteran population they serve. This has particular importance in alleviating the
insensitivities, unequal treatment, and inappropriateness of service suffered by minority -
veterans.

3. Subcommittee on Labor, Employment and Transition (See Annex D)

This Subcommittee began to develop a working plan at the September 1995
meeting One of the primary concerns was related to the services available in the local vet
centers and the medical centers.

a. Members visited a local vet center where they were provided an onentation of

: services and a tour of the facility. This was an opportunity to explore issues and concerns
of the staftas well as of the veterans.

b The Vice Chairwoman represented the Advisory Committee at the Veterans Day
Observance at the Department of Labor.

c Part C of Title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act, special programs for
veterans, 1s the major law that addresses the empioyment needs of veterans. The law
excludes veterans preference over nonveterans completely. The impact is especially felt by

nunority veterans.
12 |
",0,0,0,0
14,"d. The principal factor that contributes to the problem of minority veterans not |
, receiving their earned employment, labor and transition service benefits is one of
alienation. Minority veterans and our professional civil servants within VA and the
Department of Labor tend to keep a thin wall between each other that serves to altenate
both groups from enjoying a caring and supportive relationship, particularly when it comes
time to be passionate about minority veterans employment needs.
4. Subcommittee on Outreach and Rehabilitation (See Annex E)

This Subcommittee began to develop a working plan at the September 1995
meeting. The group identified the following priority concerns:

a. The Native American veterans continue to have the most pressing service needs.
There is an immediate need for outreach, collaboration among various organizations
whose purpose is to serve minority groups, and more and better inclusion of health care
services within minority communities.

b. There remains a critical need to hire counselors at all levels of services who are
more representative of the population served.

c. Title 38, USC Chapter 12, outlines the Department's responsibilities for
outreach while Chapter 11 covers rehabilitation. No specific reference is made to
minorities tn either Chapter. This significant deficiency must be corrected which would
then ensure a proactive approach to services.

d. Efforts to conduct Town Hall meetings continue.

e. Perhaps the one single factor that can speed up the flow, availability and
umeliness of information is the establishment of a web page for the Center for Minority
Veterans. The network would provide, eventually, an accessible tool for minority
veterans, local minority organizations, veterans organizations, and social agencies.

LE. FINDINGS
First, the Commuttee believes much good has already resulted just from the knowledge
bv a number of our veterans that first, there is an Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans and, second, a Center for Minority Veterans. There is a healthy attitude of
accountability and concern for their welfare. But the Committee's term ends in 1997: it
must be made permanent.
13
",0,0,0,0
15,"Second, fiscal restrictions affected the Committee's ability to have met all its goals and
objectives. A separate budget line account would permit the Committee to fulfill its
statutory requirements in a sustained manner. Alternatively, funding for the Committee
could be kept with the Secretary if it is set aside and not subject to restrictions. ,

Third, there is a substantial and compelling need for specific research on all the ethnic
groups of our minority veterans. Without solid, valid and dependable knowledge
regarding the needs and concerns of all our minority veterans, proper and culturally
appropriate solutions are just impossible.

Fourth, there is a supportive network of competent, committed and courageous
minority organizations in our local, regional and national communities who are dedicated
to improving the lives of all Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans,
Asian Americans, and Pacific Americans. They represent a significant resource and ally
whose capabilities must be teamed with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans, and the Center for Minority Veterans. They represent
an opportunity for genuine partnerships and collaboration and must be recognized as
valuable organizations who should present testimony to the Senate and House Veterans
Affairs Committees, as well as to other appropnate oversight committees. In this regard,
the Secretary's initiative to host a conference of minority veterans and organizations in
1996 is a giant, positive step to building solid bridges of understanding and support.

Fifth, we need to do much more in reaching out to our minority veterans who live in
rural areas, reservations, Pacific Islands, and foreign countnes. Policies and programs
must be leveled to account for all our veterans in an equitable manner. Within our great -
country, our Native American veterans legitimate and compelling needs remain invisible
and unattended. Similarly, our minority veterans who live outside our forty-eight
contiguous states, particularly Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian, American Samoan,
Chamorro, and Filipino veterans, fall between the cracks when policies, programs, and
prionties are decided. In this regard, the Native American Veterans Direct Home Loan
Program, established by Public Law 102-547, must be made a full benefit immediately to
preclude its termination in 1997. Similarly, Public Law 103-446, Section 5125, must be

amended to permit the acceptance of reports or evaluations by the Indian Health Service

, for the purposes of establishing any compensation or pension claims. And Section 2408,
38 USC, must be amended to allow Native American tribal governments, the
Government of American Samoa, the Government of Guam and the statutorily recognized
Native Hawaian governing entity to be eligible for grants-in-aid for the purposes of
establishing, expanding or improving veterans’ cemeteries.

Sixth, it 1s essential that we acknowledge the diversity of our country by recognizing
the specific ethnicity of all our minority veterans. Ethnic identifiers must be a standard
entry on the Department of Veterans Affairs initial application form that registers the

: 14 | |
",0,0,0,0
16,"veteran for health, benefits, and compensation. Additionally, a collaborative effort with
the Department of Defense Manpower Management Files would produce, at minimal cost,
a detailed and accurate ethnicity data base. This significant change will provide an
important, systemic instrument in providing better and more appropriate care for our
minority veterans. The Office of Management and Budget Directive #15, which provides
the Federal standards for racial and ethnic classification for all Federal agencies, 1s
currently undergoing a major reevaluation process that will account for the dramatic
changes in our country’s racial and ethnic diversity and which will continue. The
Department of Veterans Affairs should not hesitate or wait for the outcome of the
reevaluation; rather, it is within their authority to act now.

Seventh, the Subcommittees are unanimous in their point of view that a primary
inhibiting factor that reduces the number of our minority veterans who access VA's
services and apply for their earned benefits, as well as creates walls of frustration with the
VA system, is the absence of genuine sensitivity to the cultures of our minonty veterans.
Far too many of our VA's regional and district offices are seldom representative of the
minority veteran population they serve. Where there is a sizeable number of minority
veterans who utilize a VISN health care facility or a regional benefits and compensation
facility, they are seldom assisted through the initial service process by someone who
speaks their language or can get someone who does or can access a support system, by
someone who appreciates the strength of our country's multiculturalism, or by someone
who understands the major contributions of all veterans, particularly minority veterans.
The alienation that has been a major disruptive factor, and has been reported over such a
long period, in providing quality service to our minority veterans can be reduced and must
be eliminated. Much can be leamed and gained from a partnership with the Department of
Defense's excellent cultural sensitivity and equal opportunity programs.

Eighth, the programs that provide for our homeless minority veterans and that
support, treat and nurture hope for our minonty veterans who suffer from drug and
alcohol abuse must not be diminished. Focused research on alternative solutions
consistent with cultural values and traditions must be initiated. Dedicated research on
defining the scope of the concerns ts also necessary, as the recent survey that suggests that
50° o of minority veterans who abuse alcohol are also homeless. In this regard, recent non-
binding guidelines to VISN Directors under VHA Dhrective 10-96 place in harm's way the
VAMC Tuskegee Inpatient Alcohol Treatment Unit, as well as other treatment units
around the country that serve our Native American and other minority veterans. There is
sufficient extant literature today that clearly recommends more be done, not less.

Ninth, a consistent comment heard from nearly all minority veterans and support
organizations 1s the absence of timely, accurate information and their inability to respond
to such information when necessary. The Committee is unanimous in their belief that
current information technology ts already within the capabilities of VA to correct this
deficiency immediately.

17,"F. RECOMMENDATIONS Lo
Based on the its research, collaboration, partnerships, concerns, findings and body of
anecdotal evidence gained from actual discussions with minority veterans, minonty
community organizations, veterans organizations, and concerned leaders. the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans recommends that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs:
1. Establish a separate budget line item for the Advisory Committee on Minonty
Veterans.

2. Appropriate $125,000.00 for the fiscal year 1997 budget for the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans.

3. Recognize the appropnate regional and national minority organizations that
serve our country’s diverse population proups and invite them as genuine partners,
consultants, advisors and expert witnesses in enriching the Department's commitment to
serve the needs of our minomty veterans.

4. Authonze an assessment be conducted and a report submitted in FY '97 by the
Department of Veterans Affairs to determine the validity of the Commuttee's concern
regarding ethnic representation on the Rating Panels and the Ment Review Boards, as well
as among the counselors who advise our minority veteran populations.

5. Establish and fund an intra-agency task force, chaired by the Director of the
Center for Minonty Veterans, to conduct a needs assessment for health care, benefits and
compensation research of all our minonty veterans by ethnic groups and submit a report
by | July 1997,

6. Instruct the Under Secretary for Health and the Under Secretary for Benefits
restructure their organizations’ internal minority advisory panels to mirror that of the
Federal Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans.

7. Direct ethnic identifiers be included immediately on all appropnate Department
arpiicauion forms, particulariv the ital application form completed by ail veterans, and be
correlated with Department of Defense Manpower Files and the revisions to the Office of
\fanavement and Budget Directive #15.
8. Direct the Director. Center for Minonty Veterans, to establish a Secretary's
Task Force by | October 1996 to assess and recommend changes to current VA cultural
sensitivity policy and programs for implementation immediately upon approval of the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

16 |
",0,0,0,0
18,"9. Authorize and fund a five-member Minonty Veterans Review Commission
(MVRC), chaired by the Chairman, Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, with
consultative authority and staff support, to conduct a senes of focus meetings with
minority veterans and organizations across the country, to include the Pacific, to
determine the blueprint of needs and concerns, as well as recommendations, of all our
minonty veterans and followed by a conference on the west coast, in the Midwest. and on
the east coast to report the findings to our minority veterans. Their report would be |
presented to you for concurrence and advocacy by 1 March 1998.
10. Charge the Under Secretary for Health to take the lead in forming and funding
a Reassessment Panel, cochaired by the Director, Center for Minority Veterans and
including two members of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, to review all
programs for homeless minonty veterans and drug/alcohol treatment for minority veterans
with the purpose to implement effective, culturally appropriate, coherent and networked
programs and policies by ! July 1997. Their report would be included in our Committee's
Fiscal Year 1997 Report.
11. Inform the Under Secretary for Health to establish a Minority Health Review
Panel, cochaired by a member of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, to

21,"Annex B, Report of The Subcommittee on Health Care
1. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

The Subcommittee on Health Care, at the September 1995 meeting of the Advisory
Committee on Minonty Veterans, approved and accepted a Strategic Plan to guide and
focus their actions for FY '96 and '97 (See enclosed Strawman Strategic Plan).

This Strategic Plan was based upon the goals agreed upon at the June 1995 meeting by
all the members of the Advisory Committee. In addition, the Subcommittee members
reviewed available data and identified categories of health care needs/issues which affected
our minonty veterans (see enclosed Report).

Our concerns focused on the comments, studies, research reports, papers, and —
testimonies of other leaders, organizations and minority veterans who argued passionately
about health care needs, concerns and solutions over the years. We see the annual report
as one vehicle, among others, to provide continuous advice and consultation to the
Secretary and the United States Congress.

Finally, the lack of funding for the entire fiscal year restricted our accomplishments but
not our enthusiasm to make a difference in spite of being unable to fulfill our plans for two
subcommittee meetings. |
2. SPECIFIC | , |

The following concerns reflect the input from our enclosed Report, as well as from
comments from Subcommittee members and reports from other members of the Advisory
Committee contained in Annex F:

a There is a need to ensure cultural sensitivity and awareness in the delivery of health
care services. On September 28, 1995, the Chairman submitted a letter to the Secretary
requesting that one of the criteria utilized to select Directors of VISNs be ""demonstrated
excellence and commitment to our nation’s minority veterans"" (see enclosed Report, item
|, accountability)

b Health care services must be accessible to minority veterans.

c Decentralization of VA health care services can help meet the unique needs of our
nunority veterans in transportation, use of alternative health care services, and sharing
avreements with the Indian Health Services.

20 |
",0,0,0,0
22,"d. Research is critical to understanding the health needs of the different ethnic groups
of our minority veterans. Health care statistics play a critical part in the setting of
program priorities. This area has been the subject of much discussion, it is time to do it.

e. Recent evidence, such as the use of acupuncture, clearly supports the use of
alternative healing practices of Asian, Native, Pacific and Hispanic Americans by VA. The
minority veterans would be best served by the Under Secretary for Health by his support
for a collaborative effort with the Subcommittee for Health Care and other agencies to
examine this area and report the findings and actions to the Secretary.

f. Public Law 103-446, Section 5125, currently does not permit the acceptance of
reports or evaluations conducted by the Indian Health Service for the purposes of
establishing compensation claims, to include the original compensation claim. The Indian
Health Service is as competent as any other VA hospital or private hospital to conduct
such reports or evaluations.

g. In realigning the VA health system into the VISN concept, the Subcommittee has
requested a briefing on the specifics of the reorganization, and the Chair has met with the
Under Secretary for Health who has been supportive of our members dealing directly with
his VISN Directors in learning more of the impacts of this change. In this regard, it would
appear that some work has been done or should be done in reviewing current minority
health systems to-learn how they have been successful im meeting the needs of their
minority populations. Such collaboration, particularly with the Office of Minority Health,
the Bureau of Primary Health Care, and the Health Resources and Services
Administration, all of the Department of Health and Human Services, should prove very
beneficial in providing culturally appropriate health care to our minority veterans. -

h. It would be appropnate that VISN and other VA regional Directors implement a
minority advisory board identical, if not similar, to our Committee. The board would
function similar in mission to our Committee and Subcommittee by providing direct
information/solution exchanges between minority veterans and the Directors and
Administrators charged to serve them. The board's scope would be similar, if not
identical, to that of our Advisory Committee.

i Reductions tn either funding or scope of current substance abuse inpatient care
would be a serious disservice to minority veterans. No other Federal or state agency
provides lone term substance abuse rehabilitation; it is important that VA continue its

provram lo assist minority veterans in combatting this serious illness.
| The use of private or other contracting physician services to provide necessary health
cate for nunority veterans in urban and rural areas, reservation or trust lands is a technique
thal merits immediate review by the Under Secretary for Health. Sufficient examples exist
that demonstrate the value and desirability of this approach.
2]
",0,0,0,0
23,"k, As has been suggested by other portions of our report, there is a real need to
educate VA staff regarding the high payoff of quality customer service to all veterans.
Appreciation and understanding of the cultural values of the various ethnic groups of
minority veterans by those who serve our veterans are essential to the delivery of good
health care. There are a number of successful programs in the DoD arena that could serve
as models for VA.

{. Individual members of the Subcommittee participated in the following activities in
support of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans:

, *Met with the Chairman and other Chairs of the Subcommittees at DVA to discuss
operational plans and review future requirements.

*Met with Dr. Kenneth Kizer, Under Secretary for Health, to share our support
for the VISN realignment and discuss our Committee's and Subcommittee's roles on behalf
of minority veterans. Dr. Kizer acknowledged our missions and indicated he would have |

no problem with Committee members meeting with his Veterans Integrated Service
Networks Directors to orient them to the Advisory Committee functions and ways we
could support them in improving health care for our minority veterans.

*Requested the Center for Minonty Veterans staff obtain a list of the VISN
Directors, their locations, and biographies so that this information would be available to
Committee members, This information has been mailed to all Subcommittee members.
Guidelines for the contact of VISN Directors by Subcommittee members will be
developed.

*Conference call with Charles Johnson to discuss role, mission and focus of the
Committee, requested he provide information that would assist the Committee in
achieving its objectives.

_ *Informed by a veteran of problem he ts having with VA concerning his disability,
will meet with individual in July 1996 to discuss his issues in detail. |

24,"Annex C, Report of the Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation
1. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Based on the Committee's First Annual Report to Congress, 1 July 1995, the
Subcommittee used the goals and objectives outlined in the report in submitting its
accomplishments for the September 1995 Committee meeting minutes. Essentially, we
concluded that in terms of policies, programs and procedures the VA's benefits and
compensation programs for minority veterans seem appropriate.

Our concerns focused on the need for minority-specific research, ethnic minority
representation on both the Merit Review Boards and Rating Panels, outreach
communication, and working with the EEO offices to ascertain the nature of complaints
filed by our minonty veterans.

2. SPECIFIC

Discussions with Committee members, minonty veterans, organizations, community
leaders and input by Committee members at Annex F strongly suggest the following
findings and concerns:

a. Language and cultural values must be understood by ail those who handle
benefits and compensation claims or requests for assistance.

b. There is a lack of specific data on the number of minority veterans who are
homeless, the degree of the problem, and the specific geographic areas most affected.

c \'ISN and Regional Directors must take more aggressive steps in networking
and collaborating on creating more effective programs for minority veterans. :

d A one-stop Vet Center on the Navajo Nation should be established and become
the mode! tor other Indian nations and tribes.

e Pacific Americans and Native Americans should be authorized cemetery grants
automatically for the construction and or maintenance of veteran cemeteries on
resem ation or trust lands.

: The five-year pilot Native American Veterans Direct Home Loan Program has
been successful and must be extended beyond its original time schedule of 1997,

23 ,
",0,0,0,0
25,"g. VA must reassess its workforce to ensure there 1s a fair representation on its
staffs of the minority veteran population they are serving. This should go a long way in
eliminating, if not immediately minimizing, the insensitive attitudes now encountered by
munority veterans.

26,"Annex D, Report of the Subcommittee on Labor, Employment and
: Transition
1. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Based on the Committee's First Annual Report to Congress, July 1, 1995, the
Subcommittee used the goals and objectives outlined in the report in structuring its plan
for FY 1996.

We had hoped to have conducted two regional meetings with minority veterans and
organizations to assess current needs and concerns, revrew previously offered solutions
and recommendations, examine current VA policies, and brief the full Committee dunng
its two scheduled FY meetings.

None of the above could be implemented because neither the Committee nor the
Subcommittee was funded.

Consequently, the following report outlines the views of the Subcommittee based on
anecdotal information, experience, research, and discussions with minority veterans.

2. SPECIFIC

a. Numerous laws have been passed to meet the employment and transition needs of
veterans as a whole. However, none has been written to specifically address the needs of
minority veterans. The intent of the law is to provide services to veterans to ease the
readjustment from military to civilian life. Interpretation of the intent of the law, by the
individual agenctes assigned to carry out the law, has caused some inadequacies in the
system which affect services to veterans, specifically minority veterans.

| b. Minonty veterans, in general, feel alienated from the bureaucratic agencies that are
assined to address laws passed by legislation. The issue of the specific needs of the
minomty veteran 1s not being addressed by individual agencies. Negative attitudes towards
the minority veterans have become a visbile part of the system, and agencies themselves
do not realize the impact such attitudes have on the minority veteran population.

c Although the intent of legislative laws pertaining to veterans is sincere, agencies that
are given the administrative arm to regulate and make sure that the laws are being carned
out to meet the intent of the law have not totally ensured proper regulation of the offices
and directorates in their execution of the intent of the law.

25
",0,0,0,0
27,"d. Part C of Title IV of the Job Training Partnership Act (ATPA), special programs for
veterans, is the principal law that addresses the employment needs of veterans. This law
excludes veterans preference over non-veterans completely which demonstrates the plight
of the veterans, but in particular the minority veterans who tend to be assigned to the
bottom of the needs list.

e. Under the law, the State Employment Security Agencies are required to provide
priority services to veterans through the Disabled Veterans Outreach Program (DVOP)
and the Local Veterans Employment Representative (LVER) program. Some states have
misused this program by assigning personnel hired specifically to address the employment
need of the veterans to other non-veteran employment duties. Again, this has a serious
impact on the minority veterans that require specific assistance to meet their needs. It
would seem sensible for both VA and DOL to collaborate together on a one-stop center
so a veteran can receive employment assistance and benefits information at the same time.

f. The Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) consists of Federal
employees of the Department of Labor whose role is to assure Federal employment
programs for veterans are implemented. The VETS is answerable to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary of Veterans Employment, Education and Training. Minority veterans
need assurance that this office is carrying out the intent of the law.

g. Vietnam veterans were not provided the best support in their transition from military
to civilian life. Inadequate explanation of programs and consistent follow up to insure the
veterans rights were being properly served were the major stumbling blocks for the
veterans transition. For the minority veteran, it was even more devastating. In this |
repard, current statistics indicate that nearly 60% of the more than 800,000 military men
and women discharged since 1993 underwent the 3-day Transition,Program. It would be
beneficial to know who they were, particularly minority veterans.

h. The Department of Veterans Affairs agencies’ attitude that veterans are veterans and
they all have the same needs 1s the single, biggest mistake that has been committed.
Minority veterans have specific cultural and traditiona! needs that differ from the
Caucasian veterans. The alienation of minority veterans by agencies of VA and other
vovernmental agencies can be attributed to the absence of understanding of the different
ethnic cultural values and traditions. Minority veterans view such agencies as insensitive
to them, and while many have attempted to use their earned benefits, their first contact
with the system causes such frustration and musunderstandings that they do not return to
complete the process.

| The attitude of individual employees working for these government agencies is

26
",0,0,0,0
28,"equally the largest cause for the dysfunction in quality service to minority veterans. Little
is being done to educate, train and sensitize those who serve our veterans to understand
that the minority veterans have also sacrificed much for our country. The Department of
Defense has a number of excellent cultural and race sensitive programs that could serve
well those VA and other government agencies in upgrading whatever programs they
currently have in place.

29,"Annex E, Report of the Subcommittee on Outreach and Rehabilitation
1. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

Based on the Committee's First Annual Report to Congress, July I, 1995, the
Subcommittee used the goals and objectives outlined in the report in structuring its plan
for FY 1996.

Because of funding restrictions, the Subcommittee could not execute tts operational
plan for the fiscal year which called for two regional meetings with minonty veterans,
minority community organizations, veteran service organizations, and leaders whose
decisions impact minority veteran policies and programs.

Instead, we have had to rely on alternative techniques to press forward in identifying,
clarifying and prioritizing the needs and concerns of our minority veterans. The results,
captured in the following comments, stem from our individual discussions and research,
comments from other members of the Committee contained in Annex F, and input from
our minority veterans.

2. SPECIFIC

a. Our Native American veterans continue to have the most pressing needs for
outreach. Their geographic isolation, similar in scope to that of American Samoan and
Chamorro veterans 1n the US territories of American Samoa and Guam, causes unique
concerns that demand alternative solutions, much of which are available today. For
example, Vet Centers should be established on those Nattve American reservations and
trust lands where the closest center are many hours away by car or plane. Current efforts
to establish a Vet Center in Chinle, Navajo Nation, through a memorandum of
understanding 1s a good example of what can be done to move forward in addressing the
Native American veterans’ unique needs Drought about by geographic distances. Similar
memorandums of understanding must be pursued aggressively by VA for other Native
American tribal nations, potential Native Hawalian sovereign entity, and US territories.

b A consistent view shared by all members, and heard from many minority veterans, is
that VA must hire counselors and health care providers who are representative of the
veteran population they serve, particularly when there is a representative number of
nunority veterans who reside in the area. The balance being sought makes good sense and
does not require quotas or set asides to accomplish; rather, sound management procedures
can brinu about this necessary reorganization rather quickly.

28 ,
",0,0,0,0
30,"c. Title 38, USC Chapters 11 and 12, outlines the Department of Veteran Affairs
responsibilities for Outreach and Rehabilitation, respectively. No specific reference is
made to minorities in either Chapter. Both chapters should be amended to make specific
reference to minority veterans. It would be fair to believe that such policy changes will do
much to alleviate the perception that minority veterans’ needs are not important or do not
require cultural understanding by those who serve veterans.

d. Efforts based on our original plan for FY 1996 to conduct regional sessions continue
with the concept of Town Hall Meetings in collaboration with other Federal agencies.

e, Outreach in terms of the flow of timely, accurate and comprehensive information 1s
within the Department's capabilities. The approval to install either a web site or home
page for the Center for Minority Veterans would bring instant improvements to
accessibility and accountability by those who serve and those who are being served. It
would not take much for the Secretary to authorize and fund the Center to implement this
program by October 1996.

F Individual members of the Subcomnuttee participated in the following activities in
support of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans:

*Met with the Wasatch Front North Veterans Council, Ogden, Utah, regarding
better outreach services to minority veterans; better access to Vet Centers; collaborative
networks between the community councils and the VISN and other VA Directors;
inclusion of ethnic languages, when appropriate, in VA publications; improvement of
networks with Native American veterans in the community and on the reservations; and
inclusion of minority organizations with DVA services and programs.

*Conducted a Town Hall meeting with minority veterans and VA regional! and
medical center staff members to discuss the issues identified above.

“Met over a penod of five months with various minority veterans and minority
orpanizations to discuss many of the issues above and distribute a survey sheet focused on
needs and concerns of minority veterans.

Dear General Cooper:
This responds to your letter to the Secretary concerning recruitment for the twenty-two
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) directors.
[ am pleased to report that recruitment action was completed in Sepiember and the
selectees were announced in early October. As you recommended in your letter, we cast a
wide net in the recruitment process in an effort to reach a broad spectrum of executive
. talent from both within and outside government. In addition to announcing the positions
nationwide through the Office of Personnel Management’s Senior Executive Service
recruitment system, we advertised in The New England Journal of Medicine, Modern
Healthcare, JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, and The Wall
Street Journal.
The result of this unprecedented recruitment effort is an executive team that would be
impressive by any standard of excellence. The group of VISN directors includes
individuals with a diversity of backgrounds, both clinical and administrative, from both the
private and public sectors. Five of the new directors are women, one is Asian American,
one 1s African American, and one ts Hispanic. In terms of clinical backgrounds, nine
directors are physicians, one is a dentist, and one is a registered nurse. In addition, seven
of the new directors were recruited from the private sector. They bring new insights and
perspectives that will be of immeasurable value to us as we move toward more creative
partnerstups with both public and private health care providers in the future.
On benait of the Secretary, let me thank you for the interest and support of the committee
with regard to this important component of our effort to improve health care delivery to

, ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS
9 November 1995
The Honorable Jesse Brown
Secretary of Veterans Affairs ~.
8]0 Vermont Avenue
Washington, DC 20420 ,
Dear Secretary Brown,
The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans, specifically Richard Begay and I,
were invited to visit with Seattle's VA Regional Office on 23-24 October 1995.
Mr. Richard F. Murphy, Director, was our excellent host and developed a superb
working agenda of discussions with minority veterans and organizations as well as
with minonty employees and leaders of his organization.
Permit me to share with you the essential elements of the outbnefing that Richard
Begay and | conducted with Ms. Christine Moffitt, Assistant Director.

-Strengthen inclusivity of mimority veterans in a systemic, institutionalized
manner. The outstanding work being done by Jim Boulay as a collateral duty
should be enhanced by assignment of a full time, permanent status at an
appropriate grade level allowing direct access to the Director. An Advisory
Committee, similar in structure and duties as the Congressional Federal Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans, can be a very insightful and critical sounding

board in assisting the Director in understanding the obstacles to improving the
services provided all our minority veterans.

-Provide a clear, open and fully structured communication link for minority
veterans and organizations to those whose duty it is to serve veterans. A way of
achieving this is to establish an office similar to VA's Center for Minority Veterans
wherein all minonty veterans can see the commitment and feel the presence of
dedication to their concerns. A simple matter of having dedicated phone lines
open 24-hrs a day, seven days a week offer the hope that, when combined with a
dedicated office, concerns will be received and addressed.

-Reaffirm accountability in performance standards of those responsible for

; providing the environment for caring leadership for all employees and positive
",0,0,0,1
37,"management of programs that recognize the cultural and ethnic diversity of our
veterans. Include such accountability tn annual performance reviews. |

-Collaboration and partnership of the VISN Director and Regional Director
on all minority veterans issues and concerns will lead to synergy in resources and
information sharing. Establishing a Joint Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans, which includes minority veteran and minority community organizations,
may prove to be effective and efficient in cost avoidances in regards to surveys,
research, data collection, service opinion polls on minority veterans and more
importantly involve the local community leaders in solving the needs of minority
veterans,

-The total lack of research data on minority veterans greatly exacerbates
the issues and concems and jead to inappropriate solutions. This may be an issue,
however, best resolved at the Secretary's level.

We were impressed with the commitment and passion of the minority veteran
organizations and VA minority employees. All want to be a part of the process
and solution, and they recognize the immense value of the Advisory Committee
and the Center for Minority Veterans.

Finally, because of your clear and unmistakable leadership, there is a real sense of
hope by our minority veterans. And because of the open dialogue and supportive
relauonship the Committee shares with Hershel Gober and Hal Gracey, there is
reason for belief.

Sincerely,

39,"ADVICE & RECOMMENDATIONS ENCLOSURE
1. Compostion of Rating Panels ~
/ As a result of discussions based on anecdotal evidence, the Subcommitttee on
Compensation and Benefits agreed unanimously that a studied examination should be
conducted as to the race, ethnic and gender composition of all VA's Rating Panels that.
decide percentage ratings for veterans’ benefits and compensation. Among the many
factors that should be considered in the assessment, the following are deemed important:
(a) compilation of historical rating statistics by race, ethnicity and gender of a sufficient -
number of Rating Panels distributed across the country that would permit (b) a
comparative analysis using accepted methodologies that also recognize anecdotal evidence
from minority veterans and organizations, to include community groups and other Federal
agencies serving our veterans, and (c) assessment of the composition of Rating Panels in
terms of the race, ethnicity, and gender composition of the community they serve. The
Subcommittee recommends an initial assessment be conducted as soon as possible
followed by a more detailed examination in accordance with accepted research
principles.
2. Composition of Merit Review Boards
After discussions and review of anecdotal information, the Subcommittee on
Health recommends that an examination be conducted similar to that recommended for the
Rating Panels The intent of the assessment is to discover trends that could suggest that
chanves be made to ensure equal and fair treatment of minority veterans. There is
absolutely no call to establish separate rating processes or rules for minority veterans. The
Subcommittee believes such an assessment would be both beneficial and supportive of
\'A‘s mission to serve all veterans and that this effort would provide a meaningful baseline
for policy decisions. Major factors, in addition to those identified for the Rating Panels,
that should be included for the assessment are (a) the sensitivity of Ment Review members
to cultura! mores and ethnic values of minonty veterans, (6) the linguistic skills of Merit
Review Boards that serve populations of Hispanic American, Asian American, Native
American, and Pacific American veterans, and (c) the accessibility of the process in terms
ot ease ang tnendliness to minority veterans. The Subcommittee recommends an initial
assessment be conducted as soon as possible followed by a more detailed
examination in accordance with accepted research principles.
> Minority Veterans Research
The full Commuttee unanimously agreed that there is a significant scarcity of
research on minority veterans throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs, and in those
: few instances that there has been a research project on minority veterans, the purpose,
oo methodolowy. data, analysis and followup have been wholly inadequate. There is a
substantial dearth of information as to the efficiency and effectiveness of VA's programs

Dear Secretary Brown, — ,
In an earlier letter to you dated 28 September 1995, the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans submitted a recommendation regarding the selection critenia for the twenty-two
Directors of the newly organized Veteran Integrated Service Networks.
We indicated that based on our recent Committee meeting, 17-21 September 1995, the
letter above would be one a series of interim reports transmitting our advice on the needs
and concerns of minority veterans and recommendations with respect to the administration
of veterans’ benefits and services.
This letter forwards the second set of advice and recommendations, as an enclosure, on
the subjects of the composition of Rating Panels, the composition of Merit Review
Boards, the prioritization of effort to data collection/survey/research/studies on all ethnic-
minority veterans, and the capabilities of the Center for Minonty Veterans.
The Committee believes that your commitment to this process is vital to addressing and
resolving the needs and the quality of benefits and services provided al] minority veterans,
and in so doing clearly improving the lrves of all veterans.
We look forward to a favorable response.

While a complete record of our meeting will be forwarded to you at a later date, this letter ,
is one of a Sertes of interim reports that transmits the advice and recommendations
resulting from our meeting for your review and approval for action.
The Committee respectfully requests that the selection criteria for the position of Director
of each of the twenty-two Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) include a specific
statement that the individual's record of performance must show recognized and
_ demonstrated commitment to the delivery of health care services to the nation's minority

veterans
Additionally, it would be appropriate for your office to validate that the widest search

applicable Federal hiring procedures, before the final selections are made.
The Committee understands that the new VISN structure will decentralize the health care

and services impacting minority veterans. There is hardly any clinical research information
on minority veterans, and nor are there ongoing health care research projects, other than
the recent PTSD effort, that focus specifically on minonty veterans--how an understanding
of race. ethnicity, culture, traditions, language, and values can positively impact the
benefits and services provided by VA. A recent example of the obstacles faced by those
who wish to conduct clinical research is enclosed as a separate correspondence. Without
sufficient, timely, and accurate data and analyses provided by VA's UnderSecretaries and
Directors, the Committee's mission to provide thoughtful, productive advice and guidance
is being severely challenged. The Committee recommends that for the immediate
future VA's research priority be directed towards minority veterans and that an
aggressive approach include, among others, establishing a formal, close working
relationship between the UnderSecretaries and Directors with the Committee and
the Center for Minority Veterans.
4 Center for Minority Veterans

The Committee applauds the superb work being done by the Director and two staff
assistants of the Center for Minority Veterans. It is the view of the Committee that since
June 1995 when the Center was established, it is already overwhelmed by the issues, |
needs, and concerns of all our minority veterans and organizations across the country. ,
Why? Because it 1s seen by minority veterans and organizations as a key team member of
VA's leadership and who judiciously educates and informs those who serve our veterans
about the needs of minority veterans. The Center has become a clearinghouse for
information and an advisor to VA's leadership in improving the quality of benefits and
services provided our minority veterans. But if it is to move forward as expected by so
many, it Should (a) be composed of sufficient workers, (b) be representative of the
minority population it serves, (c) be identified as a separate line item on VA's budget
program, and (d) be allocated funding commensurate with its goals and objectives as
envisioned by the Secretary. The Committee can only conclude that prior to the creation
of the Center for Minonty Veterans, there was such a void felt by minority veterans and
orvanizations that there had to have been despair and distrust. With the activation of the
Center, there 1s a growing attitude of hope. But that can quickly dissipate to distrust if the
Center fais to move forward in resolving both individual needs and policy concerns now
and down the road. The Committee recommends the suggestions above be
implemented, ,

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS (VA)

TITLE: Response to recommendations from the Advisory Committee on 7
Minority Veterans :
ISSUE: What is the response of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to
recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans _
concerning (1) composition of rating panels, (2) composition of merit review
boards, (3) minority veterans research, and (4) Center for Minority Veterans?
DISCUSSION:
(1) Composition of Rating Panels
Recommendation: Conduct an initial assessment of racial, ethnic, and
gender composition of all VA Rating Panels as soon as possibile followed by a
more detailed examination tn accordance with accepted research principles.
Response: The Adjudication Division at each regional office contains a rating 7
activity that consists of rating specialists who rate the claims for ,
compensation, pension, and ancillary benefits. From various payroll and
personnel systems, it would be possible to determine the race, ethnicity, and
gender of most of the rating specialists, as self-reported by the individuals.
This demographic analysis of the rating boards and its rating specialists could
then be compared with the racial, ethnic, and gender composition of the |
geographic jurisdiction of the respective offices, if such a comparison were
deemed necessary for the adjudication of claims for benefits. ,
The information for the assessment and analysis requested in items (a) and .
{b) of paragraph 1, however, is not available. Veterans Benefits
Administration's (VBA) claims processing and computerized information
systems do not identify, request, or retain information about race and
ethnicity of claimants and beneficiaries. Only gender of the veteran claimant

: is requested and retained. This information is retained only in the files
locator system and the computer master record of a recurring compensation
",0,0,0,0
46,"or pension award. This information has not been captured historically
because it has not been a factor in the adjudication (rating) of claims for
compensation, pension, and ancillary benefits. If it is determined that such _
information ts necessary for adjudication of claims, it will have to be
requested and retained prospectively; as the claims processing and
computerized information systems wouid need to be appropriately revised
and expanded. ;
Finally, rating statistics by race, ethnicity, and gender for individual rating
specialists or rating boards have never been identified nor retained as part of
the claims processing, personnel performance records and computerized
information systems. As noted above, if it is determined that such
information is necessary for the adjudication of claims, then it will have to be
requested and retained prospectively, in this case, after the personne!
performance records and computerized information systems are appropriately
revised and expanded.
(2} Composition of Merit Review Boards
Recommendation: Conduct an initial assessment of the composition of merit .
review boards as soon as possible followed by a more detailed examination in
accordance with accepted research principles. The target variables include,
both cross sectional and longitudinally, race, ethnicity, gender, sensitivity to
cultural mores and ethnic values of minority veterans and linguistic skills of
board members and the accessibility of the process in terms of ease and
friendliness to minority veterans. |
Response: Medical Research Service recognizes the importance and _
desirapility of diversity in its scientific peer review process. The federal
advisory committee charter for the Medica! Research Service Merit Review
Committee states that Committee members will be selected on the basis of
professional achievement and expertise in the research subject areas needed.
“Within that context, the balance of the Committee composition will be
maintained through geographical, ethnic minority, and women |
representation.” Committee members are specifically asked for names of |
qualified replacements that are ethnic minorities and/or women. However,
2
",0,0,0,0
47,"+ :

Medical Research Service has not adopted a quota system for diversity and
we have no records of member minority status or gender for previous peer
review committees. For the 148 Committee nominees forwarded to the
Office of the Secretary in August 1995, 19 were women and 11 were ethnic
minorities. Medical Research Service has no information that sensitivity of
committee members to cultural mores and ethnic values of minority veterans
or linguistic skills of committee members in any way hampers accessibility to
or fairness of the peer review process. In fact, Medical Research Service is
aware of oniy one case in the last ten years (12,460 proposals) that our
scientific peer review process has been challenged on the basis of
insensitivity to ethnic issues. The infrequency of problems in the area of

: ethnic sensitivity causes one to wonder whether it would be prudent to
expend substantial resources to study this issue.
(3) Minority Veterans Research
Recommendation: in the immediate future, direct VA‘’s research priority
toward minority veterans and establish a formai, close working relationship
between the Under Secretaries and Directors with the Committee and the
Center for Minority Veterans.
Response: Consistent with the practices of other federal agencies, VA has
issued policy guidance for all applicants for research funding requiring the
inclusion of member minority groups and women in all proposed studies
where such inclusion is feasible and scientifically appropriate. This policy iS
based on the recognition that, to the extent that participation in research
offers direct benefits to participants, under representation of certain
population subgroups denies them the opportunity to benefit. Moreover, for
the purposes of generalizing study results, investigators must include the
widest possible range of population groups. The implementation of this ,
policy 1s monitored by the scientific peer review groups evaluating
applications for funding.

: The tnclusion of diverse population groups in research studies is the
first stage toward identifying possible minority group status variables that
may be related to research questions. When such relationships are identified

| 3
",0,0,0,0
48,"it is possible for researchers to focus on delineating what difference it makes

for example, in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, if the patient is of

one race or another. The fact that VA investigators are currently conducting

54 studies focused explicitly on research issues where race is considered

relevant is an indication that the concerns of the Committee are not being
neglected. -

The “Research Training Initiative for Historically Black Colleges and ~.
Universities and Hispanics - Serving Institutions” is another instance of the
Research and Development Program addressing minority-groups issues .
pertaining to research. To the extent that minority-group investigators can
become involved in VA research, it seems likely that research efforts will
become more sensitive to minority-group issues. Proposals submitted in
connection with this initiative are evaluated specifically for their relevance to
health care problems of minority populations. The objective of this effort is
not only to provide research training to new investigators but also to produce
research relevant to minority health problems.

The determination of research priorities is a difficult process that needs
to be done in a comprehensive framework that includes all major competing
priorities. To address the overall research priority problem, the Under
Secretary for Health has established a special advisory committee (Research
Realignment Advisory Committee Meeting) to consider several broad issues
including whether the Research and Development Program appropriately
targets the needs of veterans. The recommendation of the Advisory ,
Committee on Minority Veterans will be forwarded to the Research
Real:anment Advisory Committee.

(4) Center for Minority Veterans ,
Recommendation: Ensure that the Center is (a) composed of sufficient
workers, (b}) is representative of the minority population it serves, (c} is
identified as a separate line item on VA‘s budget program, and (d) is
, allocated funding commensurate with its goals and objectives as envisioned
, by the Secretary.

Response: The placement of the Center for Minority Veterans within the
Office of the Secretary is a reflection of the Secretary's commitment to
address the needs of minority veterans. This organizational structure helps
ensure that the special issues and problems confronting minority veterans __ |
will be appropriately examined and resolved. The budget situation for VA
Central Office precludes the assignment of additional resources to the Center
at this time. :
The Director has been tasked with assessing staffing requirements for the
Center. His initial assessment reflects the need for 2 additional staff
personnel (preferably Hispanic, Native Ameyican or Asian American). The
assessment has not been finalized for my consideration. In the interim, the
Center has established a Steering Committee to ensure that issues affecting
minority veterans are appropriately addressed by the various VA staff
elements, as well as other Federal Agencies. Although this Committee meets
monthly, it does not necessarily negate the need for dedicated staffing for
the Center. ,

Dear Secretary Brown,
After conferring with the Committee's four Chairpersons, we believe we can express
faithfully the sense of the full Committee on the issue of fulfilling the charter and the
charge you gave us and the directions from the Congress of the United States contained in
Public Law 103-446. , |
As you know, the Committee is dedicated to the charge you gave us to provide the best
and most thoughtful advice and guidance to you and the Congress of the United States on
the needs and concems of minority veterans with respect to the administration of veterans'
benefits and Services.
There is a mission-resource mismatch; as of today the Committee's budget plan for FY 96
has not been approved, either in whole or in part.
The Committee planned and scheduled a meeting in Washington, DC for 12-15 February;
it was postponed for lack of funding support. Again, the Committee planned, scheduled
and announced a meeting for 11-13 March 1996 in Washington, DC. A few days ago, we

were informed there were no funds to support the meeting.
The Committee approved, budgeted and planned to allow the Subcommittees to conduct
reviona! work sessions focused on minority veterans individuals’ and organizations’
unfiltered dialogue to assist us in meeting Our commitment to you and the Congress. We
have been unable to execute this part of our plan due to lack of funds. /
We understand the many adjustments the fiscal uncertainties have created; we have to deal
with them in our own businesses. Many members have made changes to their business
Irips and made themselves available in their locale to meet with minority veterans groups
and individuals. We have built or rejuvenated VSO networks, sought research data from:
within the Department, and met with key Department leaders. These we do as our duty;

: they require no funding support.

Dear Mr. Cooper:

This letter replies to your memorandum dated April 30, 1996, in which you make suggestions
about sharing information between the Center and the Committee. I apologize for the delay in responding
to you and | appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

| believe the Committee’s focus needs to compliment that of the Center for Minority Veterans.
The Center and the Committee have been given specific missions and directions as noted in Public Law
103-446. Both the Center and the Committee report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, but under
different circumstances and for different reasons. The Committee reports in an “advisory” capacity, while
the Center reports in an “operational” capacity. I am also the Secretary’s principal advisor on issues
affecting minority veterans.

Based on current staffing, it would be most difficult for the Center to be a daily administrative arm
to the Committee and effectively carry out responsibilities under the law, and at the direction of the
Secretary. Most importantly, we must remain responsive to the collective and individual needs of veterans.
Staffing lumitations preciude us from continually updating the Committee. Of course, crucial information
would be sent to members immediately, especially in those instances where the information is critical to
issues being examined by or referred by the Committee. We are specifically charged with assisting the
Committee when i 1s meeting in its advisory role. We can share information with the Committee, but, I
believe the best forum is during Advisory Committee meetings. We will, therefore, include items on the
agenda and provide time for the Center to update the Committee on activities and issues being worked.

We are examining the feasibility of a monthly conference call with minority veterans groups to
disseminate information about veterans issues and the Center’s activities. This forum would also provide a
was for the groups and individual veterans to communicate with the Center and each other on issues of
mutual concern. This coutd also be an excellent opportunity for committee members to receive updates on
issues being worked bv the Center.

Please feel free to contact me at (202) 273-6708 should you have any questions. -

Sub: Closing The Loop by Sharing Information
Willie,
Just got off the phone with Ron Armstead who offered a superb proposal that will
make a real difference in how we go about doing our mission; namely, the sharing of
information with the Committee on a regular basis.
Your office will become, if it isn't already, the one-stop information center for
issues, ideas, needs, letters, concerns, projects, internal VA changes, etc that affect
our minonty veterans. The Committee needs to be informed on a regular, consistent
and routine basis about such information so we can better provide advice to Jesse,

the Congress, and you. As of this note, we are not.
After our September meeting you and I chatted about establishing such a :
mechanism, and I believe the Status Chart was one step towards installing a system
of information that would not only “close the loop” on cases passed to you from the
Committee but also pass to the members what your office has discovered, learned or
unearthed on your tnps, discussions, visits, etc.
] would suspect that a monthly report to the Committee would be very helpful, as
well as setting aside a day of our meetings for your office to bring the Committee up
to date and engage the members in constructive thinking based on hard data you
provide us
\lay would not be too soon to start, don't you think?
Talk to you tomorrow afternoon as I am in conference dunng the moming.

But Public Law 103-446, Section 544, (C)(4) requires the Committee to ""meet as often as
the Secretary considers necessary or appropniate, but not less often than twice each fiscal
year."" |
And Section 544 (C)(4)(c)(1) states that ""not later than July 1 of each year, the ,
Committee shall submit to the Secretary a report on the programs and activities of the
Department that pertain to veterans who are minority group members."" The Section gives
clear guidance and expectations for a report that details the assessment of needs of
minority veterans and a comparative review of Department programs designated to meet
such needs. a
The Committee appreciates your commitment and the full support of your staff to
achieving near, mid and long term improvements to serving our minority veterans. We are
part of that process and believe a part of the team.

We wish to be held accountable to the Congress of the United States, to you as the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and most importantly to our minority veterans in fulfilling
our appointments to the Committee. Without the Department's assistance, however, our
contributions will be less than we can achieve.

We are already far down the path for 1996 with little hope of submitting the required
report on time containing advice and recommendations that make a difference in
mitigating or resolving the needs and concerns of minority veterans with respect to the

The Committee planned and scheduled a meeting tn Washington, DC for 12-15 February;
it was postponed for lack of funding support. Again, the Committee planned, scheduled
and announced a meeting for 11-13 March 1996 in Washington, DC. A few days ago, we
were informed there were no funds to support the meeting.
The Committee approved, budgeted and planned to allow the Subcommittees to conduct
regional work sessions focused on minority veterans individuals’ and organizations’
unfiltered dialogue to assist us In meeting our commitment to you and the Congress. We
have been unable to execute this part of our plan due to lack of funds. -
We understand the many adjustments the fiscal uncertainties have created; we have todeal
with them in our own businesses. Many members have made changes to their business
trips and made themselves available in their locale to meet with minority veterans groups
and individuals. We have built or rejuvenated VSO networks, sought research data from
within the Department, and met with key Department leaders. These we do as our duty;

; they require no funding support. |

clear guidance and expectations for a report that details the assessment of needs of
minority veterans and a comparative review of Department programs designated to meet
such needs. . ~
The Committee appreciates your commitment and the full support of your staff to
achieving near, mid and long term improvements to serving our minority veterans. We are
part of that process and believe a part of the team.
We wish to be held accountable to the Congress of the United States, to you as the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and most importantly to our minority veterans in fulfilling
Our appointments to the Committee. Without the Department's assistance, however, our
contributions will be less than we can achieve.
We are already far down the path for 1996 with little hope of submitting the required
report on time containing advice and recommendations that make a difference in
mitigating or resolving the needs and concerns of minority veterans with respect to the
administration of veterans’ benefits and services.
We look forward to your guidance.

Mr. David Cooper ,
Chairman -
Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans a
1106 West Abingdon Drive |
Alexandria, VA 22314 ~
Dear Mr. Cooper: |

Thank you for your May 8, 1996, letter expressing your concern
about funding for the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. I
understand that you and my Chief of Staff, Mr. Harald Gracey, met on
May 24, 1996, to discuss funding support for the Committee and
alternative means for convening the Committee. on

I sincerely appreciate the issues you raise and understand the

desire of the Committee to perform its Congressionally mandated
mission. However, as you are aware, this budget year has been most
challenging and has resulted in delayed funding for most of our
activities. We had to make adjustments to the Depaztment’s operations
based on a series of continuing resolutions, and as saich, we regrettably
suspended Advisory Committee meetings until the Department’s budget
was Tesolved. The Department’s final budget severely limits funding for
the Office of the Secretary’s travel account, which asyou know is the
source of funding for the Center for Minority Veterans and the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans.

At present, regrettably we do not have adequate funding to convene
the Committee in person. However, aS you were advised, Mr. Hensley,
Director, Center for Minority Veterans, will explore conducting a
conference call so that the Committee can discuss its draft annual
report, and fulfill meeting requirements established in Public Law 103-
446. We have successfully used conference calling in other parts of our
organization and found it to be most effective when face-to-face meetings
are impossible.

Mr. David Cooper ,

A conference call will allow members outside of the Washington
area to dial into the meeting and provide their input on the final report.
Since the final report is due to Congress in early July, I understand that
Mr. Gracey agreed to waive submission of a draft report, and you in
exchange, agreed to submit a completely polished report by August 15,
1996. |

Mr. Cooper, please be assured that Mr. Hensley and his staff will
work hard to provide the necessary support to ensure a successful
meeting by conference call. I understand that shortly he will be
contacting you and all other Committee members about the necessary
conference call arrangements.

In closing, I want to assure you that I am a firm believer in the
Committee’s mission, and continue to look forward to the advice and
recommendations of your group. ,

Sincerely yours,

The Committee extends its strongest appreciation to Secretary Jesse Brown whose
vision and wisdom have been the mirror and the lamp guiding this Committee and its members
to do what is right and just in service to all our veterans.

The Committee's third year of fulfilling its charge of providing advice and consultation to
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs on the needs and concerns of minority veterans reflected a
solid blend of Congressional support, States’ assistance, staff research, grassroots testimony of
veterans, funding availability, information sharing, and critical work by the members of the
Committee.

Our first report outlined our mission, core values and strategy; our second report detailed
sixteen specific recommendations; and this third report is based on the analytical input of the
four subcommittees, two Committee meetings, two subcommittee field visits, two Committee
teleconference sessions, and individual member site visits. It was a busy year.

The Committee strongly endorses the inclusion of performance measurement factors
that both verbally and quantitatively identify a VA leader's, manager's, and supervisor's
commitment to ensuring equality of services and benefits to minority veterans. These factors
would be made a matter of record by both the approval of a policy directive by the Secretary
and the adoption of a new individual Performance Rating Report that reflects the policy
directive.

The Committee believes that while the perceptions of cultural insensitivity and racial
disharmony have been eloquently identified by earlier studies and our reports, too few instances
of thoughtful action programs have been institutionalized to relieve the stresses of our minority
veterans. We salute and acknowledge the recent initiatives by the Department's leadership, but
the journey must involve all employees of the Department and be sustained by policies,
performance reports and funding.

The Committee endorses an operational outline for new committee members who will
follow us in fulfilling the charge over the next three years. It maintains the current mission, core
values and subcommittee structure but emphasizes specific, targeted policies and programs for
review and analysis by individual committee members.

We complete our third year with a firm sense of the wisdom and propriety of the United
States Congress in creating both the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans and the Center
for Minority Veterans. We gratefully acknowledge the professional partnership and support
provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

62,"THIRD ANNUAL REPORT
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS
A. Introduction

1. The Committee recognizes the importance of working more closely with the
Center for Minority Veterans to develop a coordinated response to the specific
concerns of minority veterans.

2. During this operational year, the Committee focused on implementing
strategies to accomplish the following goals:

a. Toreview and analyze the effects of VA policies, programs, and
procedures on minority veterans.

b. To evaluate the needs of minority veterans.

c. To develop an evaluation model to measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of the Department of Veterans Affairs.

d. To submit recommendations to the Secretary to improve the delivery of
benefits and services to minority veterans.

3. In order to accomplish these goals, the Committee identified the following
objectives for fiscal years 1997 through 1999:

a. To evaluate healthcare issues and concerns related to minority
veterans with emphasis on access, appropriateness, equity and quality
of services.

b. To evaluate the effectiveness of outreach programs and services.

c. To assess the availability of services provided to veterans using
information obtained from veterans service organizations, community-
based organizations, tribal governments, and other traditional and non-
traditional practitioners who serve veterans.

B. General Overview
1. The Committee held two formal working meetings during the year. The Fall
1996 meeting was held in Washington, D. C., and the final meeting was in
Seattle, Washington, in the Spring of 1997. Two conference call meetings
were conducted during the fiscal year. In each of the on-site meetings,
veterans and representatives of various groups presented their concerns and
issues to the full Committee.
A
",1,0,0,0
63,"2. Inan effort to reach as many veterans as possible, the Committee planned and
conducted outreach visits to veterans in geographically isolated areas. The
Subcommittee on Healthcare met with veterans in Hawaii, and the
Subcommittee on Rehabilitation and Outreach met with American Indian
veterans in South Dakota on the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Reservations. The
feedback from veterans in these areas reinforced the Committee’s decision to
conduct more field visits and town hall meetings to validate the Department of
Veterans Affairs’ effectiveness and overall success in meeting the needs of
minority veterans around the country.

C. Summary of Full Committee Meetings

1. The Fall 1996 meeting was held at the Department of Veterans Affairs, 810
Vermont Avenue, Washington, DC. Mr. Hensley, Director, Center for Minority
Veterans, briefed Committee members on the status of issues being worked by
the Center. During the meeting, the Committee finalized plans and priorities for
the operational year. The agenda for the meeting included an open forum,
which provided opportunities for the full Committee to receive updates from
various operational components of the VA. Because of the realignment of
healthcare services throughout VA, much of the meeting was focused on VHA's
plans for reorganization and its impact on veterans, especially minority
veterans.

2. Members of subcommittees met with representatives from VA to discuss issues
that affected their area of concern. The following concerns were discussed:

a. Compensation and Pension (C & P) ratings and examinations for
minority veterans - - Subcommittee members met with the Director,
C&P, Veterans Benefits Administration to address:

(1) Incomplete examinations.

(2) Disproportionately lower C & P ratings for minority veterans
(compared to non-minority veterans).

(3) Diversity training for doctors who conduct C & P examinations and
rating specialists and adjudicators, who rate claims.

b. Ethnic/racial composition of the VA staff in facilities around the country
- - Subcommittee members met with VA representatives to discuss the
impact of employment on services to minority veterans.

(1) VA staffing is not reflective of the minority population served in
some areas.
(2) Minorities are under represented at senior grade levels throughout
VA.
5
",1,0,0,0
64,"(3) Minority representation (Hispanic and Asian American) on the
Board of Veterans Appeals is very low.

c. Development of collaborative agreements with civilian healthcare
providers and minority businesses - - Committee members emphasized
the importance of the following:

(1) VA conducting more outreach to minority businesses, especially
minority veteran-owned businesses.

(2) VA using minority healthcare clinics as out-station facilities to
provide care to veterans (especially in isolated areas).

d. Expansion of VA medical research - - The Committee discussed the
need for:

(1) More VA research on minority health issues.
(2) Research on disparities in medical care to minority veterans.

3. The second meeting of the full Committee was conducted via a telephone
conference call. Mr. Hensley provided Committee members with an update on
the Center's work and accomplishments. Of special importance to this
Committee were the actions that related to the Committee’s goals and
objectives. They included the report that a new Vet Center was scheduled to
open on the Navajo Reservation in late 1997; the training of over 200 minority
veteran program coordinators in March 1997; and, efforts by the Center to
increase VA's focus on minority veteran businesses.

4. Subcommittee and individual reports indicated that the full Committee needed
to focus attention on the following areas: Reports that Gulf War Veterans were
being denied compensation and were being indiscriminately separated from
active duty; issues regarding equity of C & P exams; and, indications that the
reorganization/consolidation of VA facilities may adversely affect minority
veterans.

5. The third meeting of the full Committee was also conducted via telephone
conference call. Mr. Anthony Hawkins, Associate Director of the Center for
Minority Veterans, provided an update on the Center's activities since the last
conference call. He reported that work on the Center's Internet web page
continues and that plans for the outreach Subcommittee trip to South Dakota,
and the full Committee meeting in Seattle, Washington were being finalized.
During the meeting, some members of the Committee expressed concern that
the Matsunaga PTSD report failed to account for Asian American veterans living
on the mainland. As such, the Committee feels that the Matsunaga
Vietnam Veteran Project may not have included a significant sampling of Asian
American veterans. The Committee also discerned that there is a systematic
weakness in VA’s computer data-base network system because it could neither
track minority veterans among regional Veterans Integrated Services Networks
(VISNs) nor between VA's benefit and healthcare systems. This systematic

6
",1,0,0,0
65,"problem has a significant impact on the Center's ability to determine if minority
veterans are using the full range of programs, services and benefits offered by
VA.

6. The fourth and final meeting of the Committee was held in Seattle, Washington
on May 19-22, 1997, at the Jackson Federal Building. The open forum
provided minority veterans, veterans service organizations, state and local
officials, and VA officials the opportunity to present issues and concerns to the
Advisory Committee. Sub-groups of the Advisory Committee were established
to conduct town hall meetings in Tacoma and Seattle, Washington, and
Portland, Oregon. The Committee's sub-groups were well received by veterans
at each town hall meeting. Primary issues presented by veterans at town hall
meetings centered around the following:

a. Unfair compensation and pension ratings.

b. Lack of access to services (healthcare, education, training, and
employment).

c. Lack of transportation to healthcare facilities and other appointments.

d. Insensitivity by VA to alternative methods of healthcare and treatment.

e. Lack of minority employees at the senior decision-making levels of the
VA.

f. Lack of adequate facilities for women veterans.
(A summary of town meetings and outreach visits are attached to this report.)
D. Summary of the Subcommittee Reports

1. Healthcare Subcommittee:

a. The Subcommittee visited Hawaii for two major reasons: First, to
assess the impact of the geographic location of major VA facilities on
services to veterans throughout the state. Second, since seventy-five
percent of Hawaii's population falls into the minority veteran categories
identified in Public Law 103-446, the Committee could examine VA's
effectiveness in serving a larger population of veterans in one state.
The 72,893 minority veterans in Hawaii are defined as follows: 63,000
Asian/Pacific Islanders; 6,026 Hispanics; 3,105 African Americans, and
762 American Indians. The goals of this visit were to gather
information on the needs of Hawaiian veterans, and to assess VA's
effectiveness in the administration of health and benefits programs in
Hawail.

7
",0,0,0,0
66,"b. During the visit, Subcommittee members met with VA officials and
conducted town hall meetings with veterans and leaders of veteran
organizations. Town hall meetings were held in Honolulu, on the
islands of Oahu and Hilo, on the island of Hawaii; at Lihua, on the
island of Kauai; and on the island of Maui. Veterans in Hawaii have
many needs that must be addressed by VA. Some issues of major
concern and interest to the Committee were:

(1) Very low disability ratings for veterans with PTSD.

(2) The need for improved medical care access for veterans in
American Samoa.

(3) The need for contractual agreements with local medical treatment
facilities for veterans on neighboring islands.

(4) The need for veterans to have a better understanding of the
differences in administrative paper work required by VA medical
centers and Benefits Services Divisions.

(5) The need for employees at Tripler Army Medical Center to be more
sensitive to and respectful of Hawaiian veterans.

(6) The need for more training seminars to improve communications
with veterans.

(7) The need to expand existing primary care clinics.

(8) The lack of records accountability - - many veterans complained
that their records were lost by VA.

(9) The lengthy and unreasonable delay in processing and resolving
VA claims.

(10)The need for jobs/employment for veterans.
(11)The lack of research to address minority veterans problems that
are based on ethnic/cultural origins.
2. Rehabilitation and Outreach Subcommittee:

a. This Subcommittee visited the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Indian
Reservations to gain an in depth understanding of the issues and
concerns of American Indian veterans. No reliable information regarding
the actual number of veterans on the reservations was available at the
time of the visit.

8
",0,0,0,0
67,"b. Tribal leaders met with members of the Committee and discussed the
following:
(1) Poor access to healthcare due to distance to closest VA facility
and the lack of transportation.
(2) Procedures for scheduling appointments were ineffective and did not
facilitate optimal use of the VA facility.
(3) The lack of healthcare outreach.
(4) The lack of VA sharing agreements with Indian Health
Services to provide more accessible healthcare to eligible veterans
on reservations.
(5) The need for a more comprehensive alcohol/drug treatment
and PTSD treatment programs.
E. Recommendations
The full Committee recommends that the Secretary-Designate of the Department of
Veterans Affairs approve the 63 recommendations listed at Attachment 1 for
implementation.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans

The Committee recommends that the Secretary-Designate:

1. Establish a task force headed by the Director, Center for Minority Veterans, to
assess and recommend changes to the current VA cultural sensitivity policy and
program. The task force's recommendations should be implemented immediately
upon approval by the Secretary-Designate.

2. Establish a policy that requires decision-makers to determine if VA programs,
services, and benefits are administered in an equitable manner and are accessible
to all veterans.

3. Develop performance rating standards for all VA management personnel (facility
directors) that include rating factors to measure outreach, equality of services, and
support to minority veteran programs.

4. Develop methods for communicating and disseminating information to all veterans
about changes in services and benefits.

5. Increase outreach programs to veterans in geographically isolated areas.

6. Direct that VA officials conduct follow-up visits to sites visited by the
Subcommittees to ensure that recommendations have been implemented, and to
evaluate the effectiveness of VA programs in meeting the needs of minority
veterans.

7. Establish wellness clinic outreach programs on Indian reservations.

8. Examine the feasibility of a partnership between the Hawaii State National Guard
and the Department of Veterans Affairs that would leverage the aviation resources
of the Guard, through a subvention reimbursement program, to transport veterans
on various islands to Tripler Army Hospital for care.

9. Establish a demonstration project that allows veterans to use established
community healthcare clinics that practice culturally sensitive healthcare and, by
and large, already serve the veterans’ families.

10. Fill the vacant Deputy Director for Benefits position at the VAMROC with a local
individual who is keenly sensitive to minority veteran needs.

11. Support, with official approval and funding, the efforts of the 29 veterans’
organizations in Hilo who are proposing a “One-Stop Shop” veterans facility which
would provide accessible and consolidated VA and community services to

10
",0,0,0,0
69,"(Recommendations Continued)
veterans.

12. Reconsider consolidating the Adjudication and Benefits offices into a single entity
as this is not seen as a positive move by Hawaiian veterans, who view the current
system as broke and ineffective.

13. Review credit hours for PTSD evaluations under the managed care model to
determine the need to establish additional variables.

14. Require a joint training program for physicians and adjudicators to ensure
integration between adjudication and healthcare services.

15. Replicate at other locations around the country the models of the Center for Aging
that is being constructed at Tripler Hospital.

16. Establish some type of official Ombudsman Program whereby veterans and their
families feel they can get assistance.

17. Initiate an experimental program that allows alternative healthcare treatment
to be made available to appropriate veterans, through VA.

18. Initiate activities to insure more standardization of computer systems, and eligibility
requirements throughout the VA.

19. Provide ID cards to veterans with authorized benefit claims.

20. Provide funding and resources to document the Asian and Pacific Island veterans’
experiences and identify their specific needs.

21. Provide funding and resources to support additional research on PTSD related
depression and suicide and other related mental illnesses among Asian and Pacific
Island veterans.

22. Assist minority researchers at the Pacific Center for PTSD in acquiring the
Matsunaga Study registry for future research, and to support their study of PTSD in
Filipino veterans.

23. Recommend VA's Center for Women Veterans support and sponsor a study of
Hawaiian Women Veterans. The study could also focus on problems and issues
facing Asian Pacific Island, Caucasian, and African American women veterans.

24. Review VA practices for healthcare billing and debt collection.

25. Conduct a cohort study of the 442nd, 100th, and MIS veterans of WWII.

26. Give priority to awareness, education and research of cultural influences which

11
",0,0,0,0
70,"(Recommendations Continued)
impact veterans’ willingness to avail themselves to existing services.

2/. Re-evaluate the policies that support the immediate decrease in VA disability
ratings after veterans have attended the PTSD Center.

28. Investigate the claim by minority veterans that there are “inconsistencies in rating
board decisions for PTSD.”

29. Investigate allegations that there are apparent disparities in disability ratings
between mainland veterans and minority veterans in Hawaii.

30. Identify and provide additional assistance for veterans who are experiencing years
of delay in the resolution of their VA claims.

31. Fund a survey to determine the number of Samoan veterans in American
Samoa and on the mainland.

32. Evaluate the need for medical clinics in American Samoa.

33. Re-evaluate the procedures used by VA employees to process forms and claims
for PTSD clients - - Veterans claim the procedures are long and convoluted, and
forces them to “re-live their Vietnam experiences.”

34. Review the SBA veteran loan program and identify obstacles experienced by
veterans trying to start businesses.

35. Review the PRRP program in Hilo, Hawaii, from admission requirements to
residency treatment and post care, to determine the effectiveness of the program in
treating veterans.

36. Mandate that all PTSD counselors/clinicians in Hawaii make at least one trip to the
PRRP on Hilo to gain first hand knowledge of the residential services
that are available to their clients.

37. Initiate outreach approaches with the new Center for Aging, located on Tripler Army
Medical Center, to insure that information about the Center is well advertised
and that VA staff working at the Center are knowledgeable and open to the cultural
and ethnic diversity of potential clients and families. Examples toward this
effort would be: (a) scheduling monthly tours for the community, (6) appointing an
Advisory Committee made up of veterans and community leaders representative
of the population of Hawaii, and (c) inviting local schools (i.e., Kamehameha
Schools) to participate in the Center's holiday activities.

38. Evaluate the effectiveness of the Hawaii VAMROC.

39. Develop ways that the Hawaii VAMROC can target for service disenfranchised

12
",0,0,0,0
71,"(Recommendations Continued)
and homeless veterans who do not trust the “system.” This should be done in
concert with veterans’ organizations who are championing this veteran population.

40. Develop a formal process for identifying veterans “in distress” and expediting
services for them.

41. ldentify the reasons that veterans’ families residing on the outer Islands have
difficulty getting Honor Guards from Honolulu for veterans’ funerals and develop
a process that avoids these obstacles.

42. Provide out-station federal benefits counselors on each island in Hawaii.

43. Establish a traveling adjudication board of appeals to neighboring Hawaiian
islands.

44. Offer and conduct Agent Orange examinations for veterans in Hawaii.

45. Send a vocational rehabilitation specialist, once a month, to neighboring islands in
Hawail.

46. Ensure that current policies for authorizing in-patient care and hospitalization in
local community hospitals on the outer Islands are in the best interest of the veteran
and his family; particularly for acute and emergency situations.

47. Set up a system to monitor the number of appointments that are not kept by VA
staff with veterans and their families; initiate a system whereby these staff members
are identified and formal apologies are made to these veterans and their families
for their inconveniences related to this situation.

48. Develop an outreach program to find employers willing to hire veterans.

49. Develop training programs for medical personnel at Tripler who treat veterans in
order to improve their understanding of and communication with veteran patients.

50. Begin a tracking system to verify the complaints that veterans’ medical records are
“lost” at Tripler Army Medical Center.

51. Identify a mechanism for providing family support at Tripler Army Medical Center
when veterans are patients at this facility.

52. Initiate a system to collect on-going statistical data on minority veterans who are
treated as inpatients on the VA Psychiatric Wards at Tripler Army Medical Center.

53. Negotiate with Tripler Army Medical Center to expand the availability of hospital
beds for veterans based upon the downsizing of the military mission.

13
",0,0,0,0
72,"(Recommendations Continued)

54. Review the efficiency of service provided to veterans at Tripler.

55. Establish better communication between VAMROC (Benefits) and the veteran.

56. Include Tribal Veteran Service Officers (TVSO) on the VA’s publications
distribution list for updates to regulations, manuals, notices and publications that
pertain to veterans benefits and services.

57. VA should identify tribal veterans representatives to attend the National Veterans
Training Institute/Disabled American Veterans Service Officers Academy,
University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, to become certified claims
representatives for Indian veterans.

58. VA should insure that minority veterans are provided timely information regarding
medical evaluations for Agent Orange and Gulf War Illnesses and the related time
limits for filing claims for service.

59. Develop a closer recruitment network with veterans residing on
reservations to extend employment opportunities to Indian veterans.

60. Use veteran students attending Sinte Gieska (Spotted Tail) University and the
Oglala Lakota College at Pine Ridge as Veterans Student Workers (paid by
the VA) to assist TVSOs in putting together the critical census data of the actual
number of veterans residing on the reservations - - the outreach veterans benefits
counselor, John Wilson, can help with this process.

61. Support through funding, the Little Hoop Lodge Alcohol and Drug Treatment
community facility in its continuing endeavor to reach and help the “undocumented”
veterans suffering with PTSD.

62. Review the performance of fee physicians, under Compensation and Pension
(C&P) examination contracts, for paths of improvement in services to all veteran
clients. An unsolicited assertion from a non-Indian veteran substantiated
statements obtained earlier from American Indian veterans that they are treated in
a disrespectful manner.

63. Implement procedures for better coordination of clinic appointments for veterans
residing on the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Indian reservations.

About seven veterans presented their concerns to the Committee. Issues presented by
veterans ranged from difficulty calling the VA regional office, to inadequate treatment for
PTSD, and VA insensitivity toward women veterans.
Veterans also expressed concern about the availability of medical care at the Puget
Sound VA Healthcare System. Most veterans felt that activities similar to the health fair
held at the American Legion Hall should be held in communities where minority
veterans live.
Other issues included:
e Multiple scheduling of C & P examinations without clear notification or explanation.
e Inadequate C & P exams - - exams marginally match the DSM-IV guidelines.
e Disparate/discriminatory treatment of minority women veterans.
e Disrespectful treatment of women veterans.
e The labeling of veterans who complain as ""trouble makers.""
e Lack of cultural sensitivity by VA employees.
e Insufficient outreach by VA to minority communities.

REPORT OF THE
SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTHCARE
The activities and accomplishments of this Subcommittee were executed in support of
the goals and objectives identified by the Advisory Committee in July 1995. Specifically,
the Subcommittee focused on Goal 1 and Objective B (as listed below. )
Goal 1: To review the policies, programs, and procedures of the Department of
Veterans Affairs as they affect minority veterans.
Objective B: To evaluate healthcare issues and concerns related to minority veterans
with emphasis on access, appropriateness, availability, equity, and quality of services.
The Subcommittee conducted a 4-day site visit to Hawaii in order to gather information
on the healthcare needs of minority veterans located in the Pacific Islands and to
identify the healthcare concerns of veterans in Hawaii. The Subcommittee used town
hall meetings, public hearings, focus group meetings with veterans, their families and
veterans’ organizations, and site visits to collect information. Members visited VA
healthcare facilities on Oahu, Hawaii, Kauai and Maui. Subcommittee members were
able to examine such issues as access to care, appropriateness of care, equity of care,
availability of services, and quality of services provided to minority veterans by VA.
During the visit, it was apparent from testimonies by veterans and their families that
cultural sensitivity by VA employees was lacking. However, veterans also expressed a
deep appreciation for the services they did receive, and a desire to protect and expand
these services. This visit resulted in 64 recommendations (see Attachment 1.)
The next step for the Subcommittee is to develop a mechanism for tracking
recommendations through the resolution process.
A detailed report of the Hawaii site visit, including individual testimonies, is on file at the
Center for Minority Veterans, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue N.
W., Washington, D. C., 20420.

REPORT OF THE
SUBCOMMITTEE ON BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION

During the past year, the Subcommittee on benefits and compensation focused on the
home loan program for Native American veterans, the low rating and evaluations for
minority veterans with PTSD, and VA plans for the realignment and consolidation of
Veterans Benefits Administration functions in the field -- specifically education service.
The Committee held most of its meetings at the Department of Veterans Affairs
Headquarters in Washington, DC. In this setting veterans and veteran representatives
came to public meetings to present their concerns and issues. The Subcommittee
performed its analysis and evaluation of veteran issues in line with the goals and
objectives of the Advisory Committee.
Members of the Subcommittee met with the Director, Compensation and Pension
Service and her staff to obtain a briefing on the adjudication reengineering process.
The Director assured the Subcommittee that VA is committed to improving the
timeliness rate for processing compensation and pension claims and eliminating the
backlog of cases. She reported that her staff was working with the Office of Policy and
Planning, Veterans Health Administration, and the Board of Veterans Appeals, as a
working group, to examine ways to improve the compensation process. She shared
information about her staffs' work with the Center for Minority Veterans to develop
reliable demographic data to determine utilization of benefits and to assure the fairness
and impartiality of the rating process.
The Committee also met with employees in the VA Loan Guaranty Service to discuss
the Native American Direct Home Loan Pilot Program. Employees provided data on the
number of Memoranda of Understanding completed (50), the number of loans approved
in Hawaii and other Pacific Islands (148) and the number approved for trust land in the
United States (4).
The Subcommittee also received a briefing from the VA Education Service staff on
plans to relocate Education Services and its functions to St. Louis.

REPORT OF THE
SUBCOMMITTEE ON OUTREACH AND REHABILITATION
Rosebud and Pine Ridge Sioux Reservations
April 21, 1997

The following members of the Subcommittee visited the Rosebud and Pine Ridge Sioux
Reservations: Abel Cota, and LaVonne Willis. Ms. Joyce Bowles , Vice Chair, Advisory
Committee, and Mr. Anthony Hawkins, Associate Director, Center for Minority Veterans,
accompanied the Subcommittee. Mr. Morrison, the Tribal Veterans Service Officer,
welcomed the group to Rosebud and briefed them on the responsibilities and functions
of his office. The group was then formally introduced to Mr. William Kindle, Rosebud
Tribal President, Mr. Ron Gassman, Chairman Rosebud Tribal Veterans Affairs
Committee and Mr. Edward (Ed) Castaway, Vice Chair, Rosebud Tribal Veterans Affairs
Committee.
LaVonne Willis, Subcommittee Chair, briefly summarized the Advisory Committee’s
functions and the purpose of the visit to South Dakota’s Sioux veterans communities.
Mr. Kindle expressed his gratification to the Committee for choosing Rosebud, and
voiced his hope that the Committee’s visit would lead to more assistance and aid to
Rosebud and other Black Hills veterans.
The Subcommittee visited the VA Black Hills Healthcare System Wellness Clinic. The
facilities appeared adequately equipped to serve veterans in the surrounding
community.
Subcommittee members were provided copies of the MOU between the Department of
Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Service’s (IHS) Rosebud Community Health Care
Facility. Members of the Committee assumed this “clinic” was a mobile and fully
equipped van which operated independently. This assumption was partly based on
elements of the schedule for the drive which included calls at: the Alliance Veterans
Service Office, Alliance, Nebraska; Scottsbluff County Administrative Building,
Scottsbluff, Nebraska; New Castle VFW Club, New Castile, Wyoming; and the Winner
American Legion Hall, Winner, South Dakota. Most of these sites do not have medical
support facilities.
The “clinic” is essentially a follow-up and referral program for veterans who received
previous medical treatments at either Black Hills or Sioux Falls VA Medical Centers,
with limited “walk-in” support. The Rosebud “Wellness Clinic"" utilizes designated space
in a section of the Rosebud Comprehensive Health Care Facility (RCHCF) hospital. It
is, however, the Subcommittee’s impression that the VA Clinic staff carries “minimal”
medical equipment inside its “Wellness Clinic” support system. When the clinic is at the
IHS hospital facilities, the staff is able to use the hospital’s laboratory services. Any
additional equipment, personnel or medicine used must be agreed to in advance
between the two government agencies for billing purposes.

20
",0,0,0,0
79,"Another problem pointed out by the RCHCF staff is that there are no combined records
maintained by the two hospital systems for veterans who are being treated in both
facilities.
Traveling extended distances in the Black Hills area, is a fact of life. Hot Springs VAMC
is the nearest facility, approximately 165 miles distance. In fair weather, it is a 2.5 hour
drive from the Rosebud Reservation. Yet, appointments are still scheduled at 0900
hours in the morning for these veterans. Additional stress is caused, when lab work,
requiring fasting is a routine part of the appointment. Until early 1997, only Pine Ridge
reservation was provided a VA-supported van to transport veterans to appointments.
Each reservation now has its own VA supported transportation system in place - - the
Rosebud tribe provides the driver while VA provides the vehicle.
The Subcommittee met with the staff of the Littke Hoop Lodge - Alcohol/Drug Program.
The staff director, Marcida Eagle Bear provided a very dynamic and compelling profile
of the treatment program. This is a 12-bed residential and out-patient treatment facility
housed on the Rosebud reservation. It provides care to children and male and female
adults. This facility faces a critical challenge for its continuance. The program needs
funding in order to continue its support in helping tribal veterans, their families and
especially “at risk” children. The program’s structure is exceptionally rational in treating
Sioux veterans suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorders with associated alcohol
and/or drug dependency. The VA’s VERA/VISN concept would appear to be a perfect
match for this community agency.
The scheduled town hall meeting and dinner was held at the CYO Hall on the Rosebud
reservation. In attendance was the Hot Springs VAMC Minority Veterans Program
Coordinator, Sharyn Richards. Sharyn was very helpful in coordinating the
Subcommittee’s trip and accommodations in the Black Hills. Veterans in attendance
addressed the following topics:
e Lack of cultural sensitivity in the VA.
e Lack of knowledge (by veterans) of benefits and service offered by VA.
e Lack of knowledge about claims processing and appeal procedures.
e A need for coordinated health care.
e Inadequate/incomplete compensation and pension examinations by contracted
physicians.
e Distance to nearest VAMC for follow-up care, etc. (250 miles from Rosebud to
Rapid City.)
e High unemployment rate on reservations (86-90%.)
e Lack of statistical data on veterans residing on reservations.

Dear Secretary West:

The Fourth Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans is submitted for your
review and transmittal to the Congress of the United States pursuant to Chapter 5 § 544(C)(4) (c)(1), Title
38, United States Code. The report represents the overall consensus of the Committee on those issues
affecting minority veterans. Many of the issues identified impact the entire veterans’ community, but their
impact on minority veterans is particularly distressful.

There have been several changes to the Committee since the third annual report. While some
members’ terms of service have expired, we are fortunate to have new appointees who bring a wealth of
knowledge and experience to the Committee. This knowledge and experience was utilized in developing
the conclusions and recommendations of this report. Consequently and in view of the fact that our
predecessors did such a comprehensive job of identifying problems that plague minority veterans, we
elected to use prior reports and recommendations as the basis of our charge. We believe that much
remains to be accomplished on these recommendations. We also concluded that our energy could best be
used to assist U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs staff in implementing these recommendations. We have
reason to believe that there is a great deal of difference between what reports reflect and the actual
circumstances in the minority veteran community. We are concerned that the system is not user-friendly.

We have identified several special recommendations that require immediate action in order for VA
to achieve its “One VA” concept. These recommendations are:
¢ Make the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans a permanent committee;
¢ Significantly increase the staffing and budget of the Center for Minority Veterans;
¢ Develop and implement a plan that increases diversity in staffing of VA field operating agencies so they

reflect the diversity of the population they serve;
¢ Increase minority participation in business and research;
¢ Improve access and the delivery of services to veterans living in remote areas; and
¢ Conduct sensitivity training for the VA staff at the Headquarters and in the field.
Each recommendation will be discussed in greater detail in the body of the report. We request that you
take action on these recommendations with great urgency.

We express our thanks and appreciation to members of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the

Center for Minority Veterans for their cooperation and support in assisting us in accomplishing our mission.
Sincerely,
George B. Price
BG, USA, Ret.

The fourth annual report from the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans to the
Congress of the United States through the Secretary of Veterans Affairs is submitted in
compliance with Chapter 5 § 544(C)(4) (c)(1) Title 38, United States Code. The
Committee’s charter is to provide advice and consultation on the needs, problems, and
concerns of the minority veterans’ community, as defined in Public Law 103-446. The
definition complicates the problem of developing common solutions to many of the most
significant problems confronting minority veterans. This fact notwithstanding, the
Committee has addressed some of the problems facing minority veterans, and made
recommendations as required by law. We have not identified all of the problems
confronting minority veterans, but believe we have a good point of departure for our work.

The Committee had members rotating off due to completion of their terms of
service. They were replaced by equally competent and more diverse veterans who bring
a wealth of knowledge and experience to the Committee’s deliberations and research.
The Committee remains organized as it was initially structured, with four subcommittees:
Health Care; Compensation and Benefits; Employment and Training; and, Rehabilitation
and Outreach. Each subcommittee is responsible for assessing the VA’s administration
of the programs and services in their respective areas, and reporting their findings and
recommendations to the full Committee for action. This technique helps us to operate
more efficiently and cover more areas than otherwise would be possible. In all
deliberations and discussions, we were mindful of the budget and the constraints funding
would impose on our ability to meet and conduct field research. However, within these
budget limitations we made a field visit to Texas to assess the implementation of the
compensation and benefits program to veterans in the central Texas region. We
reviewed and assessed the provision of domiciliary care, substance abuse and post
traumatic stress treatment to veterans in the region. We also, analyzed treatment to
identify any bias that was depicted based on race. Our overall conclusion is that this area
needs intensified management to correct the problems that we found. The minority
veterans have a valid complaint concerning inequalities in the administration of veterans’
benefits in this area.

After a detailed review of the previous Committee’s conclusions and
recommendations, we decided that our energy and effort could also best be used
monitoring VA's response to the recommendations in the second and third annual reports.
The Committee received a report of action taken on the recommendations from the
Director of the Center for Minority Veterans.

We also recognized that some agencies are undertaking major reengineering
actions and policy changes in order to make them more efficient and responsive to the
veterans community. For example, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), in
recognition of the serious problems confronting almost every aspect of its operation and
delivery of services, developed its “Roadmap To Excellence,” a plan that is essentially an
action document that proposes solutions to well documented problems. The Committee
was provided copies of the plan for review and comment. The Committee proposes to

A
",0,0,0,0
86,"monitor implementation of this plan to determine if it improves the delivery of services to
veterans in general; with emphasis on its impact to minority veterans. An area of special
interest will be how VBA will reduce or eliminate the backlog of benefit claims without any
real growth in resources.

The Committee is also concerned with the authority given to subordinate activities
to plan and execute critical programs without the results or achievement of objectives
being part of the evaluation process. In other words, there may be too much autonomy
authorized in operations. This coupled with the current personnel system/process tends
to leave under-achievers in the system. It also mitigates against VA operating agency
staffs mirroring the population in the area in which they are located. This is a very serious
problem that needs to be corrected without delay. Data on the level of minority
employment is discussed elsewhere in this report. This problem impacts on the agency's
efficiency and morale as well as the veterans.

Information provided to the Committee through briefings from the VA staff and
Veterans Service Organizations indicates a need for sensitivity training throughout the
VA. This training should promote a better understanding of the veterans whom VA serve,
and promote, among other things, a culturally-sensitive work place. There is evidence to
support the fact that insensitivity may be the root cause of many of the problems relating
to the delivery of services to minority veterans. Such instances were cited during our visit
to Temple and Waco, Texas.

Our report identifies several problem areas, and the Center for Minority Veterans is
working with other VA staff to develop solutions for your approval and implementation.
The most critical problems are:

e Alleged patient abuse

e Systematic non-compliance with EEO policies

e Discriminatory practices in the employment and promotion of minorities

e Unreasonable delays in processing claims for minority veterans

e Lack of cultural sensitivity

e Insufficient funding for Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans

Overall, we applaud the Department of Veterans Affairs for recognizing that there
are major problems that must be solved. In light of budget constraints, VA’s response to
programs will require a great deal of innovation. However, we cannot lose sight of the
fact that we must improve, in any way possible, the delivery of services to minority
veterans, and that minority veterans are a unique part of the population. We pledge our
continued support and assistance in VA’s efforts to improve the delivery of benefits,
programs and services to minority veterans.

One sensitive area that we believe needs to be brought to closure is that
concerning the benefits for Philippine veterans. In our view, there service merits full
benefits based on the standards for all veterans. We urge you to support efforts to
include these benefits in future VA budgets.

THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS
A. Introduction

1. The Committee, although reorganized, recognizes the importance of
maintaining dialogue with those who have previously served on the Committee.
Their deliberations, research and findings are crucial to overall improvements in
services to minority veterans.

2. The Committee revalidated the strategies outlined in earlier reports and
strongly embraces the four goals developed by former Committee members.
Furthermore, this Committee developed an additional goal (e), which
significantly impacts on VA's ability to truly serve all veterans. The following
goals were revalidated/adopted:

a. Review and analyze the effects of VA policies, programs and procedures
on minority veterans;

b. Evaluate the needs of minority veterans;

c. Develop an evaluation model to measure the effectiveness and
efficiency of VA;

d. Submit recommendations to the VA Secretary to improve the delivery of
benefits and services to minority veterans; and

e. Review and analyze VA's commitment to diversity in the work place, and

the manner in which the workforce influences the delivery of VA services
to minority veterans.

3. The Committee's subcommittee structure will be used to accomplish the five (5)
goals. The following strategies will be employed:

a. Evaluation of VA’s application of policies, procedures and regulations in
the delivery of domiciliary care, substance abuse treatment and post-
traumatic stress disorder care to minority veterans;

b. Periodic assessment of VA's administration of compensation and
pension benefits to minority veterans and their family members; and

c. Frequent reviews of work force data for select VA medical facilities and
regional offices.

88,"B. General Overview

1. The Committee held two formal meetings during the fiscal year. Both meetings
were held in Washington, D.C., at VA Central Office.

2. Eleven new members were recommended to replace members whose terms of
service had expired. A list of those members replaced and newly appointed
members are shown at Appendix C. The Committee was increased from 15 to
18 members, which allowed for a more diverse group, with representation from
all five minority veteran groups listed in Public Law 103-446.

3. Based on budget constraints, only one of the Committee’s four subcommittees
was able to conduct field site visits and town hall meetings. The Subcommittee
on Compensation and Benefits visited VA facilities in Temple and Waco, Texas
on June 7-9, 1998. A copy of the Subcommittee report is at Appendix B. Other
Subcommittee visits were delayed until fiscal year 1999. However, it is our
view that similar situations to that in the Waco/Temple, TX area exist elsewhere
in the country.

C. Summary of Full Committee Meetings

1. The First Committee Meeting:

a. The first meeting of Fiscal Year 1998 was held January 12-14, 1998.

Mr. Willie L. Hensley, Director, Center for Minority Veterans, opened the
meeting with greetings from the Acting VA Secretary. The eleven new
Advisory Committee members were introduced. Acting VA Secretary
Togo D. West, Jr. greeted each committee member and addressed the
group. He challenged the Committee to ensure that the Nation deliver
on its promises to veterans; to point out how VA can best improve what
is being done for veterans now and in the future; and to monitor the
results of recommendations to ensure that they are being carried out.

b. The first half of the day of this meeting was devoted to an orientation for
new members who received briefings on ethics, committee
responsibilities and the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).

c. The full Committee received briefings from the Under Secretaries for VA
Health Administration, Benefits Administration and the Director, National
Cemetery System. The Assistant Secretary for Policy and Planning
provided an overview on major VA policy initiatives.

care to veterans.

e Ms. Joan Furey, Director Center for Women Veterans (CWV)
— Spoke about activities in the CWV and the Advisory Committee
on Women Veterans.

e Mr. Anthony Hawkins, Associate Director for the Center for
Minority Veterans - Provided an update on the status of
recommendations in the Committee’s three previous annual
reports.

e. The Committee elected BG George Price, U.S. Army Ret., as the new
Committee Chairman and Mr. Francisco F. lvarra as the Vice Chairman.
After the elections, Mr. Horace Grace updated new Committee members
on the goals and objectives established last year by the Advisory
Committee. The Committee also discussed the format for its next
annual report. The remainder of the day was spent in subcommittee
sessions.

f. The final day of this session focused on subcommittee meetings. The
Chairman tasked each subcommittee to develop and submit a report that
included a two-year budget and any proposed field trips. In the
afternoon, the committee reconvened to receive reports from each
subcommittee chairman on their deliberations. Each subcommittee
chairperson reported that their subcommittees desired to conduct field
visits to VA facilities in order to more closely examine the administration

8
",0,0,0,0
90,"of VA benefits and services, and to validate the concerns of minority
veterans.
2. The Second Committee Meeting:

a. The second meeting of the Committee was convened on April 27-29,
1998. The first day of this meeting was devoted to subcommittee
meetings and further updates on the status of recommendations from
the previous annual reports. The subcommittees met to work on
preparation for the final subcommittee reports and to prepare input for
the next annual report. The Committee voted to send a letter to the
Secretary expressing their desire that consideration be given to
appointing a Native Hawaiian to the vacant VA Medical and Regional
Office Center position in Honolulu. The Committee also voted to draft a
resolution in support of legislation to provide VA benefits to certain
Filipino World War II veterans.

b. The Assistant Secretary for Labor, Veterans Employment and Training
Service, briefed the Committee on collaborative efforts with VA. He
provided data on the number of veterans in the labor force. He pointed
out that unemployment rates were higher for older minority veterans
than for younger veterans. He reported that the Department of Labor
(DOL) was advocating granting licensing credit to veterans based on the
skills they had acquired through military training. The Committee
participated in a panel discussion with representatives from four
Veterans Service Organization (VSO) on issues that affect minority
veterans. Representatives from the American GI Forum, through a letter
to VA Secretary West, indicated that VA had failed to provide equality of
opportunity for Hispanic employees in the areas of promotion, training
and development for management and executive leadership positions.

c. The Committee received reports from the four subcommittee chairs.

e The Subcommittee on Health Care -- Reported on issues
relating to Native American and Hispanic veterans’ health care.
The Subcommittee raised concerns about the lack of coordination
with Indian Health Services, and the elimination of 21-day inpatient
substance abuse programs throughout the VA health care
network.

e Subcommittee on Compensation and Benefits -- Reported on
concerns with the Under Secretary for Veterans Benefits
Administrations’ “Roadmap to Excellence.” They proposed a field
visit to VA facilities in Waco and Temple, Texas (see report of visit
at Appendix B) to review allegations of disparate treatment at the
VA domiciliary and disparities in PTSD ratings for minority
veterans. The Subcommittee recommended that field hearings be

9
",0,0,0,0
91,"held in the Philippines, and that a community liaison position be
established for Native American Indians around the country.

e Subcommittee on Rehabilitation and Outreach --
Recommended a visit to Puerto Rico and Alaska to examine the
effectiveness of VA’s outreach to veterans in these remote
locations. Subcommittee members expressed concerns about
possible retaliation against VA employees at VA facilities in Seattle
following the Committee’s visit in 1997.

e Subcommittee on Employment and Training -- Submitted
thirteen recommendations for inclusion in the annual report.
These recommendations are at Attachment 2.

D. Summary of Subcommittee Reports
1. Health Care Subcommittee:

a. The Subcommittee on Health Care did not conduct any field site visits
during this reporting period. The committee focused much of its
attention on reorganizing and learning more about the new VA health
care system. In full Advisory Committee deliberation, Mr. Gumersindo
Gomez was selected as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health Care.

b. The Committee reviewed recommendations contained in its third annual
report to assess VA's progress in addressing those issues applicable to
health care. The Chairman of the Advisory Committee directed the
Subcommittee on Compensation and Benefits to assess VA’s application
of policies, procedures and regulations in the provision of domiciliary
care, substance abuse treatment and post-traumatic stress treatment at
VA facilities in Waco and Temple, Texas. Findings and
recommendations from the visit are at Attachment 1, and are discussed
at Appendix B to this report.

c. The Subcommittee on Health Care deliberated on the provision of health
care to veterans in Puerto Rico and determined that a site visit to Puerto
Rico was warranted. Although the Center for Minority Veterans
indicated that several VA officials had visited Puerto Rico, the
Subcommittee deems it necessary to hold town hall meetings in Puerto
Rico. They also want to ascertain the equity of funding, especially under
the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA), to the medical
center in Puerto Rico, which serves a large minority veteran population.
Informal information and unsubstantiated reports indicate that there are
serious problems with resource management and health care treatment
in Puerto Rico. The Subcommittee expressed a desire to schedule a trip
immediately, but resolved that the cost for the trip should be
programmed in the Center's budget for execution in February or March

2. Subcommittee on Rehabilitation and Outreach:

a. During the January 1998, meeting the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans validated the need for a Subcommittee on Rehabilitation and
Outreach. Mr. Don Loudner was selected to chair the subcommittee.
The subcommittee reviewed and revalidated recommendations from the
Advisory Committee’s third annual report.

b. The Subcommittee received a series of briefings on VA’s outreach
initiatives, and determined that further assessment and field site visits
should be conducted during the next fiscal year.

c. The Subcommittee expressed concerns about the following issue: that
VA had not responded to recommendations in the 3“ annual report that
addressed outreach to American Indian veterans living on reservations
at Pine Ridge and Rosebud, South Dakota (recommendations 60-63).

3. Subcommittee on Compensation and Benefits (Full Subcommittee report
attached at Appendix B:

a. On June 7-9, 1998, the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans’
Subcommittee on Compensation and Benefits under Manuel Doria’s
chairmanship visited VA facilities at Temple and Waco, Texas. The
purpose of the trip was to assess VA’s administration of benefits,
programs and services to minority veterans in the central Texas region.
The Chairman of the Advisory Committee, also directed the group to
assess VA’s provision of medical care to minority veterans at the Temple
Domiciliary, the Waco Post-Traumatic Stress Center and Waco
Substance Abuse Clinic. Town hall meetings were held at the Temple
and Waco facilities.

b. Subcommittee members met with the Director, Central Texas VA Health
Care System to discuss outreach to minority veterans and employment
trends in medical centers serving central Texas veterans. Specifically,
members were interested in the Director's commitment to a diverse
workforce and the manner in which his commitment was reflected in the
hiring, training and promotion of minorities at these medical centers.
Members collected information on employment trends and hiring
practices for each central Texas VA facility.

c. Members also met with the team of physicians responsible for
domiciliary care, substance abuse treatment and the PTSD program.

11
",0,0,0,0
93,"They focused on VA’s application of policies, procedures and regulations
in the administration of care to minority veterans at the domiciliary and
the substance abuse and PTSD centers. Discussions with VA staff
centered on the effectiveness of the “managed care” concept in a
“specialized care” environment. Subcommittee members, and some VA
staff, expressed concerns about inadequate staffing of outpatient
treatment programs for PTSD and substance abuse, and the release of
veterans from residential treatment programs without some form of
transitional counseling in a residential setting. Subcommittee members
expressed an interest in the number of irregular discharges (discharges
of patients before they completed the established treatment program)
among minority veterans enrolled in the domiciliary program. The
Subcommittee had received unsubstantiated reports that minority
veterans were being discharged before completion of the program, while
some other veterans remained in the program for 20/30 years.

d. Approximately 80 veterans attended the town hall meeting in Temple.
Veterans expressed concerns about the length of time it takes to
process disability claims at the Waco VA Regional Office. They were,
however, complementary of the care they were receiving at the Temple
Domiciliary.

e. Subcommittee members also met with the Director, VA Regional Office
to discuss delays in the processing of claims. The Director and the
Manager, Veterans Service Center, outlined plans for reducing the
backlog of some 13,000 cases in the Regional Office by October 1998.
The Veterans Service Center Manager indicated that about 19,000
cases were on-hand at the Regional Office. About 20% of the cases are
backlogged (a 10% backlog is more acceptable). After the meeting (and
in private deliberations), Committee members expressed concerns over
the appearance of a claims processing system that is adversarial to
minority veterans, with certain adjudicators and rating specialists
regularly using their own biases and unsubstantiated judgmental
opinions to determine what constitutes a legitimate claim for benefits.

f. A review of work force data at the Regional Office revealed some grade
imbalances and disparities in minority representation. For example, of
the 122 claims examiners, 80% are white — and there were no minority
supervisors in the section. The Director indicated that he is committed
to increasing minority representation in the work force, especially since
the pool of Hispanics and American Indians is so great in the region.

g. The town hall meeting in Waco was also attended by the news media.
The chief administrative officer, public affairs officers, and chief of staff

12
",0,0,0,0

Approximately 22 veterans from surrounding counties participated in the
forum. Veterans were very complimentary of the PTSD program — they
were less favorable about care and treatment at the substance abuse
clinic and at the medical center. They expressed confidence in
leadership at the facility and stated that they have noted several
improvements in care and treatment.

4. Subcommittee on Employment, Training and Rehabilitation:

a. In a meeting on April 29, 1998, the Subcommittee on Employment,
Training and Rehabilitation reviewed information presented by the
Assistant Secretary for Veterans Employment and Training, Department
of Labor (DOL). Specifically, members focused on the impact of several
DOL programs on minority veterans, (i.e. Job Training Partnership Act,
Disabled Veterans Outreach Program, Local Veterans Employment
Representative, Native American Employment Outreach Programs and
Small Business Initiatives).

b. Members also met with a representative of the Vocational Rehabilitation
Office. Members were concerned that VA does not maintain data that
reflects the race, ethnicity and gender of veterans using the vocational
rehabilitation program.

c. Acopy of the Subcommittee’s report is at Appendix A. The
Subcommittee’s findings and recommendations are listed at
Attachments 1 and 2.

E. Statement of Recommendations

1. The full Committee recommends the Secretary of Veterans Affairs approve the
ten recommendations listed at Attachment 2 of this report.

2. Further, the Committee recommends that the Secretary monitors VA’s progress
in implementing recommendations in this report, and brings closure to the
recommendations contained in the Committee’s Third Annual Report.

FINDINGS

1. Veterans reported instances of alleged patient abuse, by staff, at the Waco Medical
Center. Feedback from veterans indicates abuse and neglect at the facility.

2. Overall, funding of the PTSD program is considered insufficient and results in reduced
rations for patients. The quality and quantity of food is also insufficient. The nightly
milk and juice ration has been eliminated and food portions served are comparable to
those served to young children in a daycare facility. Medical research has indicated
that prescribed medications have a tendency to deplete the effectiveness of vitamins
and minerals, thereby creating an additional need to increase patient's nutritional
intake. The Temple Medical Center should reconsider the decision to prepare and
transport food to the Waco VA Hospital.

3. The shortage of staff and funds have adversely affected the Temple and Waco
Medical Centers ability to provide quality care and timely patient services to veterans.
Patients currently have to wait 18 months to secure leg braces, and nine months to
secure examinations for liver ailments.

4. There appears to be no systematic review of rating decisions to ensure that C & P
ratings for minority veterans are not disproportionately lower than non-minority
veterans. Indications are that decisions have been inconsistent and based on
conservative attitudes; i.e. “this is my tax dollar, and why should | give it to those
people.” The current claims processing system appears to be adversarial to minority
veterans.

5. The VA should establish a standard policy and procedures guide/manual for
domiciliary operations. The domiciliary at the Temple VA Hospital needs a policy and
procedures manual for veterans. Some minority veterans expressed concern as to
why non-minority patients were allowed to remain in the domiciliary for twenty-thirty
years, while others were asked to leave within six months or one year.

6. There appears to be a systematic non-compliance with Equal Employment
Opportunity policies, and practice at both the Medical Center and Regional Office in
Waco. Minority employee advancement requirements appear to be discriminatory and
exclusionary. During the period October 1993, through the present, 352
announcements were posted for vacancies at the Waco Regional Office. Of the 352
announcements, 31 Blacks, 25 Hispanic and 3 other minority employees were
selected. This disparity is indicative of repeated comments from VA employees about
the lack of minority group members in professional and managerial level positions
throughout Department of Veterans Affairs. There also appears to be a shortage of
minority doctors and nurses at VA Medical Centers in Temple and Waco.

14
",0,0,0,0
96,"7. Currently, there are no minority representatives (doctors) on treatment teams at the
medical centers in Temple and Waco.

8. Hiring and promoting practices in the Central Texas Health Care System and the
Waco Regional Office should be reviewed. While the African-American percentage of
the workforce is higher at the Temple VA Medical Center than the National Civilian
Labor Force (CLF), the average grade level of employee is the lowest, at 5.1%. The
number of Hispanics in the workforce is also very low, compared to the number of
Hispanics living in the surrounding area. Also, the average grade for Hispanic
employees is low compared to other groups.

9. Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) are not allowed sufficient time to
perform duties relative to the position. There are no full time coordinators in VBA, and
some VHA facilities, throughout VA have yet to appoint even part-time MVPCs.

10. VA should identify “reasonable” and “appropriate” resources required to resolve
unreasonable and very long delays in processing and deciding claims. Currently,
there are 6,000 pending claims on the floor at the Waco Regional Office -- 20% of
these claims are six months old. There are also 13,000 claims in process at the
VARO, some are over five years old. The El Paso Medical Center currently has a
backlog of 800 C & P examinations. It was indicated that it has taken up to six months
for El Paso to complete a C & P examination and forward it to the Waco Regional
Office.

11. The PTSD Clinic Team (PCT) program, located within the Central Texas Health Care
System, does not have a psychiatrist or psychologist to provide necessary mental
health services to patients.

12. A need exists for an outpatient/therapy clinic, for PTSD clients to visit on a daily basis
in order to resolve individual problems.

13. The dress code for PTSD patients discourages self-pride and pride in past
achievements and is considered “counter-therapeutic’ to veterans. The code should
be modified to bar only combat/camouflage clothing. Attire such as veteran’s service
organizational hats, pins and T-shirts do not fall into that category.

14. There appears to be a great need for outreach programs that focus on PTSD group
counseling in rural areas.

15. The in-patient PTSD unit at the Waco VA Hospital and the VA in-patient substance
abuse facility should be retained at all cost.

16. Benefits and entitlements awareness training seminars around the country would
possibly help improve veterans’ basic knowledge of eligibility and entitlements.

17. Medical doctors, adjudicators, rating specialist and other selected employees could

15
",0,0,0,0
97,"benefit greatly from cultural sensitivity training. Such training would facilitate more
interaction between VA staff and veterans, and enhance, non-veteran employees,
especially medical resident's knowledge of issues relative to the veteran populations
they serve.

18. A weak in-service training program exists for all VA staff.

19. Based on briefings from the Assistant Secretary of Labor, statistics based on race and
ethnicity of veterans is not maintained. As such, it is difficult to assess the
effectiveness of DOL’s employment, rehabilitation and training programs in serving
minority veterans.

20. VA does not maintain records that identify disabled minority veterans being served by
the Vocation Rehabilitation Program.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Initiate a review of the funding and operation of PTSD programs, substance abuse
programs, and domiliciary care programs throughout VA to determine, among other
things, operational sufficiency in meeting the needs of veterans, sufficiency of funding
to sustain an effective operation and adequacy of staffing to provide quality care and
treatment to veterans. (Refer to findings #1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 18)

2. Retain in-patient PTSD and substance abuse programs at all cost — these programs
serve the needs of minority veterans, who are disproportionately and more severely
affected by the traumas of war.

3. Develop standard policies and procedures for domiciliary operations. (Refer to
findings 5 & 13)

4. Investigate hiring and promotion practices throughout VA and initiate an aggressive
program for correcting grade and position imbalances, especially in areas where there
are no minority rating specialist, claim examiners, hearing officers and adjudicators,
and low minority representation in senior and senior executive service level positions.
The review and investigation should also examine efforts to recruit minority doctors,
nurses and other key medical staff personnel. (Refer to findings 6, 7, 8, 11 and 17)

5. Establish procedures for a systematic quality review of rating decisions, to include
denials to ensure quality, consistency and compliance with rating guidelines and
applicable laws. (Refer to findings 4 & 10)

6. Conduct benefits and entitlement awareness training seminars around the country to
improve communications with veterans and their basic knowledge and understanding
of eligibility and entitlement guidelines. (Refer to finding 16)

7. Establish operational guidelines for minority veterans program coordinators which
include the minimum outreach efforts and standards for performance. Direct facilities,
without an MVPC, to appoint one as-soon-as possible. (Refer to finding 9)

8. Establish effective guidelines for investigating discrimination complaints related to
medical care under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The current system is
flawed and investigations are, in many instances referred back to the facility involved
in the allegation for investigation and action. (Refer to finding 1)

9. Establish a more effective liaison with the Department of Labor on issues involving
employment, training and vocational rehabilitation of minority veterans. Encourage
DOL to track veterans programs by race and ethnicity to ensure minority utilization
trends are appropriate addressed. (Refer to finding 19)

REPORT ON BENEFITS AND COMPENSATION
SITE VISIT TO WACO AND TEMPLE, TEXAS
JUNE 7-10, 1998
OVERVIEW:
The Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation visited Waco and Temple, Texas on
June 7-10, 1998, in order to investigate allegations of discrimination towards minority
veterans both internal and external to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation consisted of the following individuals:
e Willie Hensley, Director, Center for Minority Veterans, Washington, DC
e Manuel Doria, Chairman, California
e Antonio Davila, Member, Delaware
e Cleveland Jordan, Member, South Carolina
e Horace Grace, Member, Texas
On Monday, June 8, 1998, members of the Subcommittee accompanied by the Waco and
Temple Minority Veterans Program Coordinators, visited the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center (VAMC) in Temple, Texas. There, a meeting was held with the Director of the
VAMC, to reiterate our purpose for the visit and discuss issues of concern. Other
meetings occurred with the Director of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Clinic
and members of the Clinic's Veterans Advisory Committee. A subsequent meeting was
held with the Chief of the PTSD Domiciliary Care Unit; Director of the PTSD Unit; Director
of Mental Health; Chief of Psychiatry; Medical Director of the Substance Abuse Program;
and the Director of the PTSD Unit in Waco, Texas.
On Monday afternoon, the Subcommittee held a Veterans Forum at the Temple Medical
Center. A rating specialist from the VA Regional Office (VARO) assisted in answering
concerns from 65 veterans in attendance. After the Forum, a walk through of the
Domiciliary Care Unit occurred.
On Tuesday, June 9, 1998, the Subcommittee visited the VARO in Waco, Texas and met
with its Director. Additional meetings were held with the Manager of the Veterans Service
Center (VSC); Assistant Manager of the VSC; and Decision Review Officers.
Later that morning, the Subcommittee visited the office of Congressman Chet Edwards
and met with the District Office Director and other members of the Congressman’s staff.
22
",0,0,0,0
104,"On Tuesday afternoon, a second Veterans Forum was held at the Waco Medical Center
in which an estimated 50 veterans attended. After the Forum, the Subcommittee toured
the PTSD Center facility. There, a meeting was held with veterans currently receiving
services from the center.

DISCUSSION:

Based on the series of meetings held over two days with VA management and veterans,
the following issues surfaced: (Issues are not listed in order of importance)

a. Cultural sensitivity training should be periodically required for medical
doctors, adjudicators, rating specialists, and employees. This would
result in more effective interaction between VA staff and veterans.

b. Compensation and Pension (C&P) ratings for minority veterans are
comparatively lower and not equal when contrasted to non-minority
veterans. Decisions have been inconsistent and based on conservative
attitudes; i.e., “this is my tax dollar, and why should | give it to those
people.” The claims processing system appears to be adversarial to
minority veterans, with certain adjudicators and rating specialists
regularly substituting there own biases and unsubstantiated judgmental
opinions on what is a legitimate claim for benefits. These actions lead to
“illegal” reductions in compensation ratings. The regional office staff
needs to know their veterans and become more sensitive to their needs.

c. Unreasonable and very long delays occur in processing and resolving
claims. Currently there are 6,000 pending claims on the floor with over
20% that are six months old. There are also 13,000 claims in process at
the VARO with a number of claims exceeding five years. El Paso
currently has a backlog of 800 C&P exams pending. It was indicated
that it has taken up to six months for El Paso claims to reach the Waco
VARO.

d. Benefits and entitlements awareness training seminars are necessary
for veterans to acquire a basic knowledge of such.

e. VA’s non-compliance with Equal Employment Opportunity policy and
Internal minority employee advancement requirements = are
discriminatory and exclusionary. During the period October 1993
through the present, 453 announcements were posted. Of the 453
announcements, 31 Black, 25 Hispanic, and 3 other minority employees
were selected. This disparity is indicative of repeated comments
concerning the inability and unavailability of minority group members
applying for professional and managerial level positions within the
Department of Veterans Affairs. An extensive outreach effort to recruit

23
",0,0,0,0
105,"minority personnel and veterans is warranted in order to eliminate
existing internal and external recruiting practices.

f. definite need exists for more minority doctors, nurses, and VA staff
(African-American and Hispanic) which is representative of the minority
population in the area served. This would assist in lessening the tension
among the minority groups.

g. Insufficient time is allocated to the Minority Veterans Program
Coordinators to perform the duties necessary for effective interaction
with staff and veterans.

h. A weak in-service training program exists for all VA staff.

i. Currently there exists no minority representation in treatment teams at
the medical centers.

j. In order to have a formal and effective process of interaction and
representation at the director's level, sufficient staff (minority and other)
is necessary in the PTSD / Substance Abuse Unit.

k. A need exists for an outpatient/therapy clinic, for PTSD clients to visit on
a daily basis in order to resolve individual problems.

1. Closer and more effective coordination is necessary at the program
management level, in order to develop a system that addresses
inpatient-resident-outpatient issues.

m. All services offered at the medical centers must be equal for both male
and female veterans. Both staff and patients should be made aware of
equality issues pertaining to female veterans.

n. The PTSD Clinic Team (PCT) program, located within the Central Texas
Heath Care System, is in immediate need of employing a psychiatrist or
psychologist to provide the necessary mental health services to patients.
Both the inpatient PTSD program and the inpatient Substance Abuse
program should be retained at all cost.

o. Overall funding of the PTSD program is insufficient and results in
reduced allocations for rations in the areas of quality and quantity for
patients. The nightly milk and juice ration has been eliminated and the
food portions served are comparable to those served to young children
in a daycare facility. Medical research has indicated that prescribed
medications have a tendency to deplete the effectiveness of vitamins
and minerals, thereby creating an additional need to increase patient’s

24
",0,0,0,0
106,"nutritional intake. Temple Medical Center should reconsider the decision
of preparing food and transporting it to the Waco VA Hospital.

p. The dress code for PTSD patients discourages pride in self and in past
achievements by being considered “counter-therapeutic” to the veteran.
The code should be modified to only address combat/camouflage
clothing. Attire such as veteran’s service organizational hats, pins, and
T-shirts do not fall into that category. Other staff members and
supervisors refer to staff members that support veterans as “militant”.

q. The alleged issue of patient abuse, to include physical abuse of veterans
by staff members, at the Waco Medical Center, needs immediate
attention. |Feedback from veterans indicates abuse, neglect and
intolerance to the needs of patients.

r. Outreach programs need to be established in rural areas in order to
provide veterans access to services offered by the Department of
Veterans Affairs.

s. Prioritizing and timeliness in addressing and meeting medical needs of
patients is questionable; i.e. patients should not have to wait 18 months
to secure needed leg braces for mobility or wait nine months to secure
an examination for a liver ailment.

t. The domiciliary at the Temple VA Hospital needs to establish an equal
policy and procedure manual for all veterans. Some patients were
allowed to remain in residence for extended periods of time (decades)
while others were asked to leave within a year.

While we have outlined the problem areas, we would like to emphasize that there are
many proactive individuals who consistently work under stressful conditions to overcome
obstacles and accomplish the “overt” mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
The findings of the Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation substantiate a Prima
Facie dilemma well rooted in ethnological intolerance, and one that prohibits the effective
delivery of services to minority veterans. Our recommendation is to require that the
Department of Veterans Affairs further investigate the visited sites in order to eradicate
vestiges of intolerance, manifested injustices, exclusionary tactics and practices.
That the Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation schedule a minimum of two visits
per fiscal year to ascertain the impact of VA policy and services on minority veterans
throughout these United States and its territories.

25
",0,0,0,0
107,"CONCLUSION:

The Subcommittee’s visit to Texas was a “Ray of Hope” for minority veterans as well as
majority veterans that attended our Forums. Numerous e-mail communiqués indicate
support of the efforts made by the Center for Minority Veterans and the Minority Veterans
Advisory Committee. It will benefit the Department of Veterans Affairs to fiscally increase
its support of the Center for Minority Veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs must
implement the necessary changes to both internal and external policies that are currently
resulting in discriminatory practices and exclusion of minority veterans to benefits,
services and employment.

VA’S RESPONSE TO ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Initiate a review of the funding and operation of PTSD programs, substance
abuse programs, and domiciliary care programs throughout VA to determine,
among other things, operational sufficiency in meeting the needs of veterans,
sufficiency of funding to sustain an effective operation and adequacy of staffing
to provide quality care and treatment to veterans. (Refer to findings 1, 2, 3, 5,
11, 12, 13, 14 and 18)

VA Response:

VA has an ongoing program evaluation of its PTSD programs. Veterans Health
Administration's Mental Health Strategic Healthcare Group (MHSHG) is responsible for
ensuring that evaluations are conducted by the Northeast Program Evaluation Center
(NEPEC), located at the VA Medical Center, West Haven, CT. These evaluations include
information on staffing, funding and assessments of treatment outcomes. The adequacy
of domiciliary care programs is also evaluated by NEPEC. MHSHG programs for
addictive disorders are similarly reviewed by the Program Evaluation Center, located at
the Palo Alto VA Health Care System. All program evaluations include data on numbers
of minority veterans served. Evaluation results are provided to the Veterans Integrated
Service Network (VISN) leadership. In addition, the Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Health Care Organizations (JCAHO) routinely surveys the adequacy of
VA medical center and domiciliary care program operations and facilities for accreditation
purposes. Domiciliary care program operations and facilities are also surveyed by the
Commission on the Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF).

2. Retain in-patient PTSD and substance abuse programs at all cost — these
programs serve the needs of minority veterans, who are disproportionately and
more severely affected by the traumas of war. (Refer to findings #11 and 15)

VA Response:

VA appreciates support for the continuation of inpatient programs for patients with
PTSD and for those with addictive disorders. The need for a continuum of care for
veterans with PTSD and addictive disorders, including specialized inpatient, residential,
outpatient and community based care is part of the Mental Health Strategic Health Care
Group’s policy as expressed in VA’s Practice Guidelines on PTSD and on Addictive
Disorders. It is essential that VA retain capability to serve those veterans with PTSD and
/or addictive disorders whose clinical needs require inpatient/residential care. There are
some patients whose severity and/or complexity of illness requires such care at some
times in their clinical course if they are to be successfully treated. We are concerned that
in a few facilities, specialized inpatient/residential PTSD or Addictive disorders programs

32
",0,0,0,0
114,"have apparently been eliminated at times without adequate alternative programs being

made available. This issue was presented by VHA’s Committee on Severely Chronically

Mentally Ill Veterans and is currently under review. There is a study on development of

utilization management criteria for Evaluation and Brief Treatment PTSD Units and PTSD

Residential Rehabilitation Programs being carried out by the VISN 20 MIRECC. We

anticipate this will strengthen awareness of the utility of these services.

3. Develop standard policies and procedures for domiciliary operations. (Refer to
findings 5 & 13)

VA Response:

Non-concur. System-wide standard policies and procedures relating to the
operation of Domiciliary Care Programs are outlined in VA Manual M-5, Part IV,
December 6, 1990.

4. Investigate hiring and promotion practices throughout VA and initiate an
aggressive program for correcting grade and position imbalances, especially in
areas where there are no minority rating specialist, claim examiners, hearing
officers and adjudicators, and low minority representation in senior executive
service level positions. The review and investigation should also examine
efforts to recruit minority doctors, nurses and other key medical staff
personnel. (Refer to findings 6, 7, 8, 11 and 17)

VA Response:

Each VA Regional Office is required to conduct an annual workforce analysis in
connection with the submission of their Annual Affirmative Employment Reports and
Update for Minorities and Women. The workforce analysis compares the employment
levels of minorities and women in Regional Offices to their representation in the
respective civilian labor force areas. In many instances, the percentages of minorities
and women in VA Regional Offices meet or exceed their percentages in the civilian labor
force and in some instances, the percentages of minorities and women falls below those
in the civilian work force. Other issues covered in the Regional Office Affirmative
Employment Program Work Force Analyses include recruitment and hiring, rates of
promotion, training and development and separations.

With regards to the Advisory Committee's finding #6, the number of positions filled
at the Waco Regional Office during the five year period between 1993 and 1998 was 352.
For the same period, the number of African Americans hired was 35, the number
Hispanics hired was 28 and other minority employees hired were 4. Based on these
figures, the percentage of minorities compares favorably with civilian labor force (CLF)
data for the Waco metropolitan (recruitment) area. The employment comparisons are as
follows:

| Ethnicity | WACO | Civilian Labor Force |
33
",0,0,0,0
115,"LF)
The Waco Regional Office will continue to use every opportunity to target external
recruitment efforts to attract quality minority job candidates.

VBA has implemented a new succession planning initiative, entitled ""Opportunity
98"" under which selected VA regional offices have been authorized to hire entry level
Veterans Service Representatives (VSRs), experienced vocational rehabilitation
counselors and employment specialists. One hundred positions will be filled in FY 1998.
The action plan for filling these positions, which has been communicated to the
participating regional offices, emphasizes outreach strategies to attract a diverse
applicant pool to complement the existing work force. VBA has made use of the
Outstanding Scholar Program in its external recruitment efforts to fill the VSR positions.
We have targeted colleges and universities that have predominate or sizable minority
student populations as a prime recruitment source. To date, minority men and women
comprise 30 percent of the positions filled under this initiative.

VBA will continue to address any imbalance between the number of minorities and
non-minorities in targeted positions such as rating specialists, claims examiners, hearing
officers and adjudicators, as well as in senior level positions.

34
",0,0,0,0
116,"5. Establish procedures for a systematic quality review of rating decisions, to
include denials, to ensure quality, consistency and compliance with rating
guidelines and applicable laws. (Refer to findings 4 & 10)

VA Response:

Training packages on rating procedures are nearing completion. Additionally, a
quality review program, entitled: Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR),"" has
been implemented. Both of these initiatives should contribute to an improvement in the
overall quality of our decisions and our ability to assess and correct problems in the
application of rating principles and guidelines.

With regard to the Committee's finding # 10, which pertains specifically to the
Waco Regional Office, the station Director has indicated that the regional office has
always followed the policy of being ""liberal"" in granting as much as possible (to veterans)
within the law. No substantiated evidence has been presented by the Advisory
Committee to support the claim that there are ""illegal"" reductions in ratings or
inconsistencies in rating that are the result of biases against minority veterans. If specific
Information substantiating this allegation is made available, VBA will conduct an
immediate investigation.

6. Conduct benefits and entitlement awareness training seminars around the
country to improve communications with veterans and their basic knowledge
and understanding of eligibility and entitlement guidelines. (Refer to finding 16)

VA Response:

Outreach efforts are important part of customer service. Access to VA benefits
information and claims assistance is critical to ensuring that potential VA beneficiaries
receive the benefits they have earned. Veterans benefits counselors and field examiners
routinely provide information briefings on veterans benefits at service organization events,
community job and health fairs and at homeless stand-downs. Outreach is also provided
to Native American veterans on Indian reservations.

VBA continually reviews the scope of its outreach services to assess its success in
reaching veterans and their families. VBA has also initiated teleconferencing as a new
method to reaching a greater number of current and potential beneficiaries.

7. Establish operational guidelines for minority veterans’ program coordinators,
which include the minimum outreach efforts, and standards for performance.
Direct facilities, without an MVPC, to appoint one as-soon-as possible. (Refer to
finding 9)

35
",0,0,0,0
117,"VA Response:

Minimal Operational Standards (MOS) will be established for Minority Veteran
Program Coordinators (MVPCs) in FY 1999. MVPCs will be required to report on their
efforts to meet MOS during the submission of annual reports. Those facilities without
MVPCs will be directed to appoint coordinators before the end of calendar year 1999.
Also, the position description for MVPC that outlines their duties and responsibilities will
be reviewed and updated in FY 1999.

8. Establish effective guidelines for investigating discrimination complaints
related to medical care under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The current
system is flawed and investigations are, in many instances referred back to the
facility involved in the allegation for investigation and action. (Refer to finding
6)

VA Response:

| am directing the review of the employment situation at the Central Texas Health Care

System that you have described in the report. As to the recommendation that the entire

VA system be investigated, such an initiative would be premature at this time.

The Committee report stated that “Veterans reported instances of patient abuse, by staff

at the Waco Medical Center. Although, no specific instances were cited in the report, any

allegations of patient abuse should be reported immediately to the appropriate facility

Officials, the Office of the Medical Inspector or the Inspector General, Office of Healthcare

Inspections. Even though the report does not substantiate this serious allegation, it is

always our intent to investigate every specific allegation of patient abuse and neglect.

9. Establish a more effective liaison with the Department of Labor on issues
involving employment, training and vocational rehabilitation of minority
veterans. Encourage DOL to track veterans programs by race and ethnicity to
ensure minority utilization trends are appropriate addressed. (Refer to finding
19)

VA Response:

The effectiveness of VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling (VR&C)
program liaison activity with the Department of Labor's (DOL) Veterans Employment and
Training Service (VETS) has improved dramatically since both Departments signed the
Memorandum of Understanding in August 1995. As such, delivery of service within the
Vocational Rehabilitation program has improved for all veteran participants, including
minority veterans. By way of example, 5,361 graduates of the Vocational Rehabilitation

36
",0,0,0,0
118,"program were referred in fiscal year 1996 to DOL's Local Veteran Employment
Representatives (LVERs) and Disabled Veteran Outreach Program Specialists (DVOPs)
for employment services. Of the 7,395 veterans who were declared rehabilitated by VA in
FY 96, 1,343 veterans (18.2%) were assisted by LVERs and DVOPs. In fiscal year 1997,
VA referred 8,452 vocational rehabilitation graduates to DOL representatives, 50%
increase from the previous year. DVOPs and LVERs assisted 3,411 of the 8,693
veterans declared rehabilitated. This represented an increase of 154% over the previous
year.

To further fine-tune the ongoing partnership between VA and DOL, we have just
recently completed the first of six joint training seminars for staffs of our respective
Departments. The training program is the outgrowth of a joint VA/DOL task force and
touches upon a broad array of rehabilitation topics such as communication and
sensitivity, which we recognize as being relevant to the diverse population we serve
today.

The recommendation relative to DOL tracking activities has been referred to that
Department for response. The Center for Minority Veterans will monitor DOL’s response
and provide the reply to the Committee.

37
",0,0,0,0
119,"10. Include in the VA's FY 2000 budget, $90,000 for Advisory Committee
meetings and site visits.
VA Response:

The Center for Minority Veterans included in its FY 2000 budget $62,000 for
Advisory Committee travel requirements and honoraria. If additional funds are identified,
they will be made available for any unfunded Advisory Committee requirements.
Other Issue:

The Committee recommends that the Secretary monitor VA's progress in
implementing recommendations contained in the Committee’s Third Annual Report.
(Page 9 & 11)

VA Response:

The Center for Minority Veterans monitors the status of all outstanding
recommendations. The Director reports the status of these recommendations to the
Advisory Committee during its meetings. Recommendations relating to outreach to
American Indian veterans at Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations have been
satisfactorily addressed by the Veterans Health Administration.

Dear Secretary West:

It is an honor to submit the 5"" Annual Report of the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans, pursuant to § 544, Title 38, United
States Code. The report represents the views and consensus of the
Committee on those issues affecting minority veterans. As we have
stated in previous reports, many of the issues we identify impact the
entire veterans’ community, but the impact is particularly acute and
distressful on minority veterans. Our recommendations and
suggestions are designed to minimize or eliminate the distress, and to
assist the Department in its efforts to remove barriers to minority
veterans’ use of VA benefits, programs, and services.

Our report focuses primarily on the Committee’s visit to Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands. Such visits continue to prove very valuable in
identifying and validating problems that exist in the delivery of services
to minority veterans and veterans in remote and isolated areas.

We are concerned that the Center for Minority Veterans remains,
after 4 years, understaffed and under funded. As such, initiatives and
programs in support of the Center's legislative mandate and
responsibility to minority veterans can not be fully implemented. This
issue must be resolved. The report contains other issues that will
require VA’s immediate attention.

We were delighted to have you visit our Committee and reconfirm
your support of our efforts to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs
in discharging its responsibilities to minority veterans. Your support for
our Committee to become permanent is greatly appreciated.

3
",1,0,0,0
123,"The Committee looks forward to welcoming the new appointees
whom you assured us would be forthcoming. These appointments will
provide us with a broader range of experiences to draw on in
performing our duties. In our judgement there remains much work to
be done.

Again, we express our thanks and appreciation to members of the
VA staff for their cooperation and support. We are especially pleased
with the efforts being made by the Office of Small and Disadvantaged
Businesses, to promote and develop minority and small business
opportunities throughout VA; the Office of the Assistant Secretary for
Planning and Analysis with regard to the on-going program
evaluations; and the VA Office of Medical Research Service, in
promoting studies and research on disparities in minority health care.

Introduction
The Committee continues working closely with the Center for Minority
Veterans to develop a coordinated response to the specific concerns of minority
veterans and to implement strategies to accomplish previously established goals,
which are to:
="" review and analyze the effects of VA policies, programs and procedures
on minority veterans,
= evaluate the needs of minority veterans,
= develop an evaluation model to measure the effectiveness and efficiency
of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
= submit recommendations to the Secretary to improve the delivery of
benefits and services to minority veterans.
In order to accomplish these goals, the Committee identified and revalidated
the following objectives for fiscal years 1997 through 1999. In this regard, the
Committee must:

126,"General Overview

This is the Fifth Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans. The Committee conducted two mandatory meetings as required by
Title 38, United States Code §544. The two meetings were held at VA Central
Office, Washington, DC, on January 12-14, 1999, and April 26-29, 1999. The
Committee also conducted site visits to VA facilities in San Juan, Puerto Rico
(PR), and St. Croix, US Virgin Islands (USVI), on April 5-9, 1999.

The terms of service for seven members of the Committee expired in
December 1998. Major General Fred A. Gorden, (U.S. Army, Retired) was
appointed to fill one of the seven vacant positions. Approval of nominees to fill
the remaining vacancies is still pending. During this reporting period, the
Secretary of Commerce, in accordance with Title 38, USC §544, appointed a
representative to serve as an ex officio member on the Committee.

The Committee reviewed several program areas during its meetings and
received briefings from VA officials on such issues as:

= VA Medical Research

=» Veterans Benefits Administration's Reorganization and Business Re-

engineering Processes

» VA's Women Veterans Programs

# Innovations in Veterans Employment and Training Programs

=» VA Education Program Evaluation

= Readjustment Counseling Programs

« VA's Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program

«= Office of Resolution Management

The Committee also reviewed the status of recommendations from previous
reports and expressed concerns that many recommendations had not been fully
implemented. Some of those recommendations are discussed further in this
report.

The Advisory Committee’s Subcommittee on Health Care proposed a site visit
to VA facilities in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The
Committee unanimously approved the proposal, and the visit was scheduled for
April 5-9, 1999. The visit was conducted to assess the effectiveness of services
provided to veterans living in the Caribbean Islands. While the principal areas of
interest were health care and benefits entitlements, several other areas were
examined based on complaints from veterans in the region.

In addition to meetings with VA officials, Committee members met with
representatives from various veterans’ service organizations and officials from

3
",0,0,0,0
127,"the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands’ Departments of Veterans Affairs. Members
also met with veterans and family members in a series of town hall meetings
conducted at several locations in Puerto Rico and in St. Croix, VI. The town hall
meetings were very informative and were supported by VA facility directors and
staff. More than 600 veterans were contacted during these site visits.

Based on a review of budget reports, briefings from VA staff and an analysis
of funding in Veterans Integrated Services Network 8 (VISN) , the Subcommittee
concluded that VA should examine funding for medical care provided to veterans
residing in the Caribbean. The Subcommittee also found that veterans from the
Virgin Islands are adversely affected by language barriers when trying to use
benefits and other services in Puerto Rico, where Spanish is the primary
language. Transportation and access to services are major problems for
veterans residing in both the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.

These issues (problems) are discussed in more detail in this report and are
accompanied by Committee recommendations for improving health care and the
administration of benefits to veterans in the Caribbean.

Members of the Subcommittee on Outreach expressed concern that the
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is not conducting aggressive outreach
activities to notify Native Americans veterans, who are potential beneficiaries, of
the Native American Direct Home Loan Program. While VBA has indicated that
limitations on resources preclude them from conducting outreach as specified by
law, the law has not been changed, and therefore VA is not in compliance with
the provisions of Public Law 105-297. Further, outreach information briefings, to
make veterans or their surviving family members aware of existing VA programs
and entitlements, are needed to encourage and promote the use of VA programs
and services.

The Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation concluded that the
Department of Veterans Affairs has not aggressively supported the Filipino
Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 1999 (H.R. 1594), which contains three
major provisions. The provisions are designed to:

= provide 100 percent parity for Filipino service-connected veterans residing

in the United States who were wounded, injured or imprisoned during
World War II (WWII), and who were previously receiving half of the
monthly compensation of their American counterparts;

® allow WWII Filipino veterans residing in the United States to be eligible for

health care at VA clinics and hospitals; and

= provide an annual funding of $500,000 to the VA Outpatient Clinic in

Manila, Philippines, to treat Filipino veterans.

",0,0,0,0
128,"The Subcommittee expresses serious concern about the administration of
VA benefits to WWII Filipino veterans. Seemingly, VA has not taken a
supportive position on this issue. Committee members believe that the lack
of support and advocacy (by VA) seriously jeopardizes the passage of
legislation to provide full benefits to Filipino veterans.

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
Overview:

The Subcommittee on Health Care, augmented with other Committee
members, visited Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands on April 5-9, 1999, to
assess VA’s delivery of health care and administration of benefits to veterans in
the Caribbean. The Committee cited, as a rationale for the visit, the fact that
numerous veterans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands had complained
about VA services in letters to the former VA Secretary. The Committee focused
on the following areas: Health Care, Outreach and Benefits, as well as other
services provided by the Department to veterans residing in these territorial
possessions of the United States.

e Arecibo, Puerto Rico e Bayamon, Puerto Rico

e Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico e St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands
Approximately 600 veterans were contacted during the town hall meetings.
General:

The report is organized into the following areas: VA’s Administration of Health
Care, Barriers to Access (Transportation and Language), Outreach, VA Regional
Office Administration, National Cemetery Administration and Veterans Service
Organization Issues.

VA’s Administration of Health Care:

The medical center staff provided briefings and background information on
the operations of health care facilities and medical programs in Puerto Rico and
the U. S. Virgin Islands. Based on a review of budget documents, the San Juan
VA Medical Center appears to be severely under-funded and does not appear to
receive, on par, funds comparable to other VA facilities in VISN 8 and within the
contiguous United States. The shortage of funds severely affects the ability of
the Medical Center Director to conduct outreach, provide medical care to eligible
veterans, and enroll eligible veterans in PR and USVI.

The following issues were presented during town hall meetings/veteran
information forums, and/or during meetings with VA staff, officials of the PR and
USVI Departments of Veterans Affairs, and representatives of Veterans Service
Organizations:

e Appointments for initial medical evaluations and follow-ups were being

cancelled without prior notification to the patient/veteran.

e Appointments for treatment of diabetes as well as other medical ailments
are not immediately available/accessible. There is at least a four-month
waiting period for an appointment.

7
",0,0,0,0
131,"e Veterans complained that too often they do not see the same physician
when reporting for follow-up clinic appointments. The primary care team
concept is not working in PR.

e There are several critical position vacancies at the VAMC. For example,
the Ponce and Mayaguez Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC)
provide mental health services to about 2,000 mental health patients.
However, there were only 2 physicians available to handle the caseload,
with each doctor seeing about 1,000 unique patients (each). The facilities
are authorized 4 full-time equivalent positions. Additionally, a medical
specialist is not assigned to the Mayaguez Outpatient Clinic; therefore,
patients are routinely referred to the Ponce Outpatient Clinic or the San
Juan VAMC.

e The VAMC offers virtually no services or separate wards/semi-private
rooms for women veterans. Women veterans are housed with male
veterans without regard to their special needs, to include privacy.

e Civilian Health and Medical Program VA (CHAMPVA) information and
services are limited in PR and the USVI when compared to information
and services available on the mainland.

e Veterans must purchase over-the-counter medications prescribed to them
by VAMC physicians. Some medications are not readily available at the
VAMC pharmacy.

e Communication between the VAMC and personnel located at other VA
facilities in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands is extremely deficient. For
example, the VHA Directive relating to patient enrollment, issued within
the last 2 years, has only recently been distributed and implemented in the
Caribbean region. A shortage of funds and the inability of the facility to
treat more veterans were determined to be possible reasons for the delay
In implementing the VHA Directive.

e The Director (VAMC) expressed very little interest in reaching out to all
Priority Group 1-7 stakeholders. There are concerns about the facility’s
ability and capacity to meet the needs of additional veterans. Currently,
the VAMC serves only 40 percent of eligible veterans living in the region.

e There are no inpatient post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment
programs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Although 30 percent of
the Hispanic veteran population suffers from PTSD, residential programs
do not exist, and patients are referred to the mainland for inpatient care.

e There are no established procedures for assisting walk-in patients.
Veterans sometime wait all day and are not interviewed or seen by a

fire safety hazard for wheelchair bound veterans and for those who are
bedridden. The unit should be relocated to the entry level or main floor of
the VAMC.

e The USVI CBOC is too small. The Clinic Director’s office is also used as
an examination room.

Barriers to Access (Transportation and Language)

Transportation and language present two unique barriers to care and use of benefits
by veterans in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. While most printed
correspondence is in English, most verbal communication in Puerto Rico is in Spanish.
Consequently, veterans from the U.S. Virgin Islands encounter some difficulty in
communicating when they travel to VA facilities in San Juan, PR. Even in those
instances where English is used for non-Spanish speaking veterans, the distinctness of
the Virgin Islander’s dialect, in many instances may pose a unique barrier to their smooth
and efficient access to services. Verbal communication should not be overlooked as a
barrier to care and other VA services. The absence of bilingual (English and Spanish)
written Communication represents a barrier to all veterans in the Caribbean. Some
specific issues presented to Subcommittee members included:

e Travel Expenses. The cost for travel to the VAMC, from remote areas in
PR and the USVI, creates an extreme financial hardship on veterans and
their family members. Individual cases reflect that veterans in PR and the
USVI pay as much as $60.00 and $250.00, respectively, to travel for
appointments at the San Juan VAMC.

e Printed Information. Brochures and pamphlets in Spanish, pertaining to
veterans’ benefits and medical entitlements, are not available throughout
the island of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

e Lack of Sensitivity. Veterans complained that VA personnel lack
sensitivity in dealing with them or their family members. Such core values
aS compassion and respect must be reinforced in the work place.

e Communications. Follow-up letters to veterans are printed in the English
language only. Bilingual (English and Spanish) form letters would improve
communications with veterans.

133,"Outreach

VA outreach to veterans in the Caribbean region is non-existent. As such,
veterans are not getting information about benefits, medical services and other
entitlements unless specifically requested. Information is not routinely
disseminated, and town hall meetings and veterans’ information forums are not
held. | Subcommittee members expressed concern over the lack of general
benefits information and the absence of an established VA-initiated outreach
program. It was suggested that an effective outreach program might help
improve communication with the veteran community and promote greater use of
VA benefits and programs. There were indications that the Medical Center
Director would prefer not to establish an outreach program because it could
possibly result in his facility not being able to provide adequate care to eligible
veterans. The shortage of funds and staff has a significant impact on outreach.

The Director of the Regional Office acknowledged the need for more outreach
in the USVI and agreed to provide partial funding for a full-time minority veterans
program coordinator.

Readjustment Counseling Service has an effective outreach program and is
successfully addressing the needs of veterans suffering from post-traumatic
stress disorder. Vet Center personnel are well respected by veterans in the
Caribbean. These personnel have forged an invaluable professional relationship
with veterans in the area.

Veterans in the region lack basic knowledge of VA benefits and entitlements.
As such, they are frustrated, confused about benefits issues and distrust the
VAMC and VARO. No VAMC or VARO programs to educate veterans and their
families about medical services, submission of claims or appeals procedures
were evident. There was no indication that a Gulf War veterans’ program exists
in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

VA Regional Office Administration

During the visit, members of the Committee received briefings from the
Director, VA Regional Office, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and from employees at the
facility. It was determined that 25 percent of the veterans in the Caribbean are
receiving disability compensation, compared to about 12 percent on a national
level. While this figure is about twice the national average, Subcommittee
members did not feel that the trend was significant, considering the high
percentage of Hispanic veterans who served in combat units during wartime.
However, members expressed concern that the high percentage may result in
unnecessary and unfair focus on ratings and compensation awards at the facility.

10
",0,0,0,0
134,"This extra scrutiny and previous GAO studies may have facility employees overly
cautious and somewhat conservative in their ratings. Members could not
validate this to be a problem but felt it was an issue that VA managers and senior
officials should monitor.

The high volume of medical reimbursement claims received by the regional
office is also contributing to delays in the processing of disability claims.
Generally, it takes several months (4-5 months) to process medical
reimbursement claims. Often, the Director has to redirect staff to accommodate
this requirement. Additional full-time staffing could possibly alleviate this
problem, or the use of trained temporary personnel would help improve
processing time without detracting from an already demanding disability claims
process. A minimum of eleven additional VARO personnel in the areas of
adjudication, decision ratings, and appeals need to be hired. This increase in
staffing would greatly assist in easing the frustrations felt by veterans concerning
delays in obtaining benefits decisions.

Supervisors at the regional office could not provide, when asked, the number
of backlogged disability claims or the total number of claims pending. Therefore,
members felt that procedural improvements in the management of claims, from
receipt to completion, should be a priority at the facility. A tracking system that
adequately reflects the status of all claims in the system by age and by months
and years should be established and consistently used. Such a system would
insure that the oldest cases are worked in priority order.

During town hall meetings, numerous veterans complained about poor
communications at the facility. They stated that they routinely encounter difficulty
when trying to get information from the RO about the status of their claims and
that the processing of claims take absolutely too long. Over 25 cases were
presented to Subcommittee members at the meetings. These cases were
referred to the Director of the Regional Office, who has provided periodic updates
to the Subcommittee and the Center for Minority Veterans.

The Director has taken significant steps to improve the automation capability
of the USVI Office of Veterans Affairs to assist veterans in determining the status
of their claims. The benefits of this system were immediately evident during the
visit. Communications with the Office of Veterans Affairs appears to be effective
and consistent. However, written communication (correspondence) from the
Regional Office directly to veterans should be reviewed to ensure that it is clear,
concise and understandable. The use of bilingual letters (in both English and
Spanish) should be explored.

Other issues relative to Regional Office Administration include:

11
",0,0,0,0
135,"e According to veterans, Compensation and Pension (C&P) ratings for
Puerto Rican veterans are comparatively lower and not equal to those
ratings received by minority and majority veterans residing on, or traveling
to, the mainland.

e An updated system for the distribution of claims folders is required
immediately. Folders are currently placed on a table, sectioned off with
tape. This procedure is considered haphazard because the sections are
not adequately identified. A misfile could result in folders being routed to
the wrong individuals or teams, thereby contributing to the delay in
processing veterans’ claims for benefits.

e Permanent secretarial staff is needed to assist the Veterans Service
Center Manager at the VARO.

e The Vocational Rehabilitation and Counseling Service fails to secure
employment for veterans within the required 75 days after the veteran is
job ready.

Bayamon VA National Cemetery

A Subcommittee team visited the VA National Cemetery at Bayamon, Puerto
Rico. The newly appointed Cemetery Director briefed the team and conducted a
tour of the administration facility and the cemetery grounds.

Extensive work is being done at the cemetery to repair sunken gravesites
affected by soil erosion. This project is well underway and the results were
clearly evident. The erosion is attributed to several factors, including natural wet
weather (rainy) conditions and the drainage of swimming pools onto cemetery
property by local residents. However, the most significant factor contributing to
soil/land erosion around gravesites was the improper “filling” procedures used by
the cemetery in the past. The Cemetery Director had already taken steps to
prevent further soil/and erosion around gravesites.

lt was noted during the tour of the grounds that local residents were dumping
trash and debris onto cemetery property, especially in the area earmarked for
future expansion and development. Although the Director has met with local
residents to discuss this matter, dumping continues to be a problem.

During the exit briefing, Subcommittee members discussed the dumping
problem and the problem with local residents draining their swimming pools onto
cemetery property. Several representatives from Veterans Service
Organizations stated that they have members and chapters in the Bayamon
community where the cemetery is located and that they would work within the
community to resolve these issues.

Veterans Service Organizations

Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) and the Department of Veterans
Affairs for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were very supportive of the
Subcommittee’s visit. Several VSOs coordinated many of the town hall meetings
and disseminated information to veterans about the visit.

Representatives of the Blinded Veterans Association, Puerto Rico Regional
Group, presented the following issues/concerns to the Subcommittee:

e Homemaker Services Program -- The program has been reduced from 6
months to 4 months, and it takes at least 11 months (waiting period) for
veterans to be scheduled to participate.

e Respite (Break) Program -- A program is needed for family members who
care for veterans suffering from Alzheimer’s illness.

e Nursing Home Care Unit -- The program is not available to Alzheimer’s
patients. Entry and exit points to the Nursing Home facility should be
controlled to keep the patients within the facility's boundaries.

e Transportation -- Round-trip transportation from outpatient clinics in Ponce
and Mayaguez to the VAMC at San Juan is needed. Public transportation
in San Juan is very expensive and difficult to obtain.

e Ophthalmology Services -- An Ophthalmology Clinic is needed at the
Mayaguez OPC. Statistics indicate that 14.2 percent of those veterans
who are blind live in the Mayaguez region. Mayaguez is the farthest point
from the San Juan VAMC. Blind veterans living in the Ponce region (9.23
percent) are already receiving ophthalmic services at the Ponce
Outpatient Clinic.

e Programs to Assist Blind Veterans — Frequently, important programs for
blind veterans such as the “Computer Access Training,” although operated
successfully in other Blind Rehabilitation Centers, take an extremely long
time before they are considered for implementation at the San Juan Blind
Rehabilitation Center.

Recommendations
Overview:

The Committee decided to request that VA provide periodic updates on its
progress in resolving issues and recommendations presented by the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans. During deliberations, it was determined that
several recommendations were still pending action by VA. The Subcommittee on
Benefits and Compensation was tasked to review several recommendations from
the Second, Third, and Fourth Annual Reports.

Discussion:

The Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation determined that the
following recommendations from the Second Annual Report of the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans, July 1, 1996, are still open and require VA's
immediate attention:

e Recommendation #3: Recognize the appropriate regional and national
minority organizations that serve our country’s diverse population groups
and invite them as genuine partners, consultants, advisors, and expert
witnesses in enriching the Department's commitment to serve the needs
of minority veterans.

e Recommendation #15: Submit a request to Congress to amend Section
2408 of 38 U.S.C. to permit tribal governments, the Government of
American Samoa, the Government of Guam, and the statutorily recognize
Native Hawaiian government to be eligible for grants-in-aid for the purpose
of establishing, expanding, or improving veterans’ cemeteries.

17
",0,0,0,0
141,"The following recommendations from the Committee’s Third Annual Report of
July 1997 are considered open and require VA action:

e Recommendation #2: Establish a policy that requires decision-makers to
determine if VA programs, services, and benefits are administered in an
equitable manner and are accessible to all veterans.

e Recommendation #3: Develop performance rating standards for all VA
management personnel (facility directors) that include rating factors to
measure outreach, quality of services, and support to minority veterans.

e Recommendation #30: Identify and provide additional assistance to
veterans who are experiencing years of delay in the resolution of their VA
claims.

The Subcommittee On Benefits and Compensation proposed that the
Advisory Committee conduct a comprehensive review of VA Manual M-5, Part IV,
dated December 6, 1990, based on VA’s response (non-concurrence) to
recommendation #3 in the Advisory Committee’s Fourth Annual Report. In this
report, the Committee concluded that VA should establish a standard policy and
procedures guide/manual for domiciliary operations. The recommendation was
based on findings from a site visit to the Temple VA Medical Center where it was
determined that policies and procedures did not exist or were not being followed.
For example, some minority veterans indicated that non-minority patients were
allowed to remain in the Temple Domiciliary for (as long as) twenty-three years,
while they were asked to leave within six months to one year. In addition,
veterans expressed concerns about the dress code. They felt that the dress
code for PTSD patients discourages self-pride and is “counter-therapeutic” to
veterans. Such items as service organization hats, pins, and T-shirts are
currently prohibited at the domiciliary.

",0,0,0,0
142,"Recommendations:

The Committee recommends that the:
Number 1. Acting Under Secretary for Health appoint a task force to
recommend solutions to the situation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
with a view toward developing ways to improve services across the board.
Particular emphasis should be placed on the equitable allocation of funds under
the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation (VERA) and the elimination of
barriers that preclude full and unimpeded access to care and benefits. The task
force should include in its assessment how improvements can be made in such
areas as: medical appointments, patient privacy, primary care teams
management, pharmaceutical services, medical claims reimbursement,
beneficiary travel, and implementation of eligibility reform guidance.
Number 2. Director, San Juan VA Medical Center, explore operating a shuttle
between the VA Medical Center and Outpatient clinics. The Committee believes
that implementation of a shuttle program will not only solve many transportation
problems for the veterans, but will also reduce the overall cost of travel
reimbursements.
Number 3. Secretary emphasize and establish guidelines for increasing
contracting opportunities for minorities, veterans and women-owned businesses.
Further, the Secretary should review, analyze and initiate corrective actions,
especially in VA Central Office (VACO), where minority and small business
contracting goals/targets are not being achieved or are being ignored.
Number 4. Secretary require that all form letters mailed to veterans residing in the
Caribbean be printed in both English and Spanish to accommodate the veterans
who may not be bilingual.
Number 5. Secretary ensure that the Center for Minority Veterans is sufficiently
staffed and funded to meet the statutory responsibilities outlined in Public Law 103-
446. The Committee recommends that the Center's staff be immediately increased
to seven people and that funding for such initiatives as a minority veterans’ summit
be fully supported, funded and executed in calendar year 2000.

19
",0,0,0,0
143,"Number 6. Acting Under Secretary for Health establish an inpatient
PTSD program in Puerto Rico for veterans residing in the Caribbean region.
Number 7. Director, San Juan VAMC, initiate a project to relocate the Spinal
Cord Injury Unit from the third floor to the main floor of the Medical Center.
Number 8. Directors of the San Juan, Regional Office, and the San Juan Medical
Center, establish mandatory cultural sensitivity training for employees at their
facilities. The Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration and the
Director, VA Center for Minority Veterans, should assist in the development and
implementation of the training.
Number 9. Under Secretary for Benefits authorize an increase in staffing for the
San Juan Regional Office to handle the high volume of medical reimbursement
claims.
Number 10. Director, San Juan Regional Office, and Director, San Juan VA
Medical Center, conduct more veterans information forums and town hall meetings
in both Puerto Rico and the USVI. The MVPCs at these facilities should be an
integral part of the planning and actual execution of town hall meetings and
information forums.
Number 11. Director, VAMC San Juan, appoint a working group to address and
resolve the concerns of blind veterans. The working group should also focus on
recommending the best location for Ophthalmology services for blind veterans who
reside in Puerto Rico.
Number 12. Under Secretary for Benefits comply with the provisions of Public Law
105-297 and implement an effective outreach program to support the Native
American Direct Home Loan Program. In this regard, Minority Veterans Program
Coordinators should be used to assist veterans.
Number 13. Congress of the United States pass legislation to provide equitable VA
benefits to World War II Filipino veterans who reside in the United States.
Number 14. Under Secretary for Benefits initiate a review of the Vocational
Rehabilitation Program in the Caribbean. Particular attention should be focused on
improving program outcomes and effectiveness with regard to job placement of
veterans who are declared job ready.

The Honorable Togo D. West, Jr.
Secretary
Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue, N.W.
Washington, DC 20420
Dear Secretary West:

It is an honor to submit the 6 Annual Report of the Advisory Committee
on Minority Veterans pursuant to § 544, Title 38, United States Code. The report
represents the views and consensus of the Committee on those issues affecting
minority veterans. As we have stated in previous reports, many of the issues we
have identified impact the entire veterans’ community, but the impact on minority
veterans is particularly acute and distressful. Our recommendations and
suggestions are designed to minimize or eliminate the distress through positive
actions that address the root causes of the problems. We view ourselves as
partners with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), working together to
remove barriers to minority veteran’s use of VA benefits, programs and services.
It is a pleasure to report that the Committee believes that it has inspired the
confidence of the Department's staff and field directors, as well as, the veterans’
population. We have tried to operate as members of the team aspiring to
propose well-thought out solutions to problems we have identified.

This report will focus primarily on the Committee’s visit to the Oneida
Nation in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Our visits are very valuable in
identifying/verifying problems as well as learning of programs and initiatives that
are working and are worthy of emulation. The Committee’s visit to the Oneida
Nation in Green Bay, Wisconsin was highly successful. We were very impressed
with the overall organization, partnerships, teamwork and mutual support of the
various veterans directors, organizations and individuals at every level in the
state of Wisconsin. Governor Thompson set a very positive tone for service and
support to veterans with his appointment of a State Secretary of Veterans Affairs
with an accompanying budget. He also appointed a tribal coordinator for the
Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs. This permits all claimants of funding
to know the budget cycle and thereby eases the administrative burden
associated with submitting budget requests. The details of our visit will be
discussed elsewhere in this report, but we thought the overall organization and
support were so innovative and so well executed that it merits highlighting in this
letter. The issue of service to veterans living is isolated areas remains a
problem. The Wisconsin initiatives, with adequate funding, may be a nation-wide
solution to this problem. They have used specially configured vehicles to take
service to the veterans. The only impediment is funds and weather.

2
",1,0,0,0
150,"We can say without fear of contradiction that much of the change in
attitude and confidence in this Committee stems from your support and the
positive action you have taken on our recommendations. For instance, your
memorandum regarding Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) means
they have now come out of the closet and can help their activities achieve the
mission of support to veterans. It stimulated action at all levels and has been a
source of great relief to MVPCs. The same is true of providing them time to
attend important conferences organized and conducted by the VA Center for
Minority Veterans (CMV). Not everyone has responded but we are much further
ahead than we have been in the past.

We were delighted with your visit to our Committee and to receive
affirmation of your support and your guidance. We appreciate you taking time
from your busy schedule to speak to us. Your visit certainly confirms our
comment to new Committee members that you support our program and charge
us with keeping you and the Congress informed on important issues involving
veterans in general and minority veterans in particular. Our new Committee
members bring some much-needed expertise to the Committee and we
appreciate your rapid response to vacancies with new appointments.

This report represents the results of a comprehensive review of all issues
identified in previous reports and annotates those that remain unresolved. You
may be interested to know that since 1995, the Committee has submitted a total
of one hundred eleven (111) recommendations, of which only 18 remain
unresolved with five (5) having been forwarded to other Federal agencies. This
record could not have been achieved without outstanding support from you, the
Center for Minority Veterans and other VA staff and Federal agencies.

The foregoing achievement not-with-standing there remains a few issues
in the report that need highlighting in this letter. The issues are as follows:

e Puerto Rican Veterans Service. The plight of the Puerto Rican
veterans remains basically unchanged from that described in our
previous report. This issue needs to be resolved with priority. The
same is true of the Philippine veterans.

e The CMV continues to perform their duties in an outstanding manner.
Your authorization of additional positions will assist the CMV in
realizing its full potential. It also will help the Center be more
diversified. As we, the ACM\V, intensify our effort to achieve our
mission it would be helpful if the Center had one more position so a
staff person could be designated to support our Committee. The
workload certainly justifies this request.

e Indian Health Service has not been testing for HIV and Hepatitis C
infections because they don't have the funding to provide necessary

to this problem with this agency.

e Outreach Programs. Outreach programs need a vast improvement
across the board. This area becomes more critical as we attempt to do
medical research in the minority community.

e Increase the pay scales for the Board of Veterans Appeals so they can
compete with other agencies for appeal judges—we need to at least
maintain parity with other agencies in our quest for talented Appeal
Judges.

Once again, the ACMV expressed its thanks and appreciation to all VA
staff for their cooperation and support. We are especially pleased with the
response to problems we have identified. Members of the ACMV are available
for special discussion necessitated by our recommendations.

Sincerely,
George B. Price

Sixth Annual Report
July 1, 2000
Introduction
The Committee continues working closely with the Center for Minority
Veterans to develop a coordinated response to the specific concerns of minority
veterans and to implement strategies to accomplish previously established goals,
which are to:
Review and analyze the effects of VA policies, programs and procedures
on minority veterans,
1. evaluate the needs of minority veterans,
2. develop an evaluation model to measure the effectiveness and efficiency
of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
3. submit recommendations to the Secretary to improve the delivery of
benefits and services to minority veterans.
In order to accomplish these goals, the Committee identified and revalidated the
following objectives for fiscal years 1997 through 1999. In this regard, the
Committee must:
evaluate the health care issues and concerns of minority veterans with
emphasis on access, appropriateness, equity and quality of care;
evaluate the effectiveness of outreach programs and services; and
assess the availability of services that are provided to veterans using
information obtained from veterans service organizations, community
based organizations, tribal governments, and other traditional and
nontraditional practitioners who serve veterans.

154,"General Overview

This is the Sixth Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans. The Committee conducted two mandatory meetings as required by
Title 38, United States Code §544. The two meeting were held at VA Central
Office, Washington, DC, on January 26-29, 2000, and June 5-7, 2000. The
Committee also held a meeting during a visit to Oneida Nation, Green Bay,
Wisconsin, on October 27-29, 1999.

The Committee reviewed several program areas during its meetings and
received briefings from VA officials on such issues as:

VA Medical Research

Veterans Benefits Administration’s Reorganization and Business Re-

engineering Processes

VA’s Women Veterans Programs

Innovations in Veterans Employment and Training Programs

VA Education Program Evaluation

Readjustment Counseling Programs

VA’s Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program

Office of Resolution Management

Minority Health Status from the Office of Minority Health Perspective

Hepatitis C - Diagnosis and Treatment

Update on Puerto Rican Veteran’s Concerns

The Committee also reviewed the status of recommendations from
previous reports and expressed concerns that several recommendations had not
been fully implemented. Selected recommendations are discussed in this report.

The Advisory Committee’s Subcommittee on Outreach proposed a site
visit to the Oneida Nation, Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Committee unanimously
approved the proposal, and the visit was scheduled for October 27-29, 1999.
The visit was conducted to assess the effectiveness of services provided to
veterans living in the Oneida Nation, Green Bay, Wisconsin. While the principal
areas of interest were health care and benefits entitlements, several other areas
were examined based on complaints from veterans in the region.

In addition to meetings with VA officials, Committee members met with
representatives from the Oneida Nation and officials from the Wisconsin
Department of Veterans Affairs. Members also met with veterans and family
members in a town hall meeting conducted at the Oneida Nation. The town hall
meeting was very informative and was supported by VA facility staff. More than
40 veterans attended the town hall meeting.

",0,0,0,0
155,"Based on a review of budget reports, briefings from VA staff and an
analysis of funding in Veterans Integrated Services Network 12 (VISN), the
Subcommittee concluded that VA should examine funding for medical care
provided to veterans residing in the Oneida Nation. The Subcommittee also
found that cultural insensitivity barriers adversely affect veterans from the Oneida
Nation when trying to use benefits and other services in Green Bay, WI.
Transportation and access to services are major problems for veterans residing
in the Oneida Nation, as well as other Native American communities.

These issues (problems) are discussed in more detail in this report and
are accompanied by Committee recommendations for improving health care and
the administration of benefits to veterans in the Oneida Nation.

Members of the Subcommittee on Outreach expressed concern that the
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) is not conducting aggressive outreach
activities to notify Native American veterans, who are potential beneficiaries, of
the Native American Direct Home Loan Program. While VBA has indicated that
limitations on resources preclude them from conducting outreach as specified by
law, the law has not been change, and therefore the VA do not comply with the
provisions of Public Law 105-297. Further, outreach information briefings, to
make veterans or their surviving family members aware of existing VA programs
and entitlements, are needed to encourage and promote the use of VA programs
and services.

The Subcommittee on Benefits and Compensation concluded that the
Department of Veterans Affairs has not aggressively supported the Filipino
Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 1999 (H.R. 1594), which contains three
major provisions. The provisions are designed to:

provide 100 percent parity for Filipino service-connected veterans residing

in the United States who were wounded, injured or imprisoned during

World War II (WWII), and who were previously receiving half of the

monthly compensation of their American counterparts;

allow WWII Filipino veterans residing in the United States to be eligible for

health care at VA clinics and hospitals; and

provide an annual funding of $500,000 to the VA Outpatient Clinic in

Manila, Philippines, to treat Filipino veterans.

The Subcommittee expresses serious concern about the
administration of VA benefits to WWII Filipino veterans. Seemingly, VA
has not taken a supportive position on this issue. Committee members
believe that the lack of support and advocacy (by VA) seriously
jeopardizes the passage of legislation to provide full benefits to Filipino
veterans.

156,"Report on Site Visit --Green Bay, Wisconsin
Overview:

The visit to Wisconsin served to demonstrate what could be achieved
when all agencies and activities operate as a team and focus on service to the
veteran. We were encouraged by what we heard and saw. In our view, the
Wisconsin programs merit emulation in other states and areas. The detached
comments from officials briefing are included in the minutes, which are attached.
While our focus was on health care, we also reviewed programs relating to other
entitlements and supporting programs.

As outstanding as the program in Wisconsin is, certain areas remain a
challenge. One that is most difficult to solve is the delivering of service to
veterans living in remote areas. They have a specially configured vehicle but
even this cannot overcome the winter weather on the peninsula. This issue is
one that is a wide spread problem from the islands in the Pacific through Alaska
to areas in the South and Northwest. We are actively seeking solution to this
problem. We had already identified this issue.

The sharing agreement between the Oneida Nation and DVA for medical
service provides a relief for the veteran population. This arrangement should
serve to improve the quality of health care.

The plight of homeless veterans and other special need veterans are
being met with varying degrees of success. What Wisconsin VSO’s have
discovered is that once a veteran has been rehabilitated then they need to have
a change of environment from the old community or circumstance thy just left.
Often the only family support they have is from the veteran community. This has
led Wisconsin to provide a fee base domiciliary as part of their overall program.
This helps the veterans help themselves and reduces recidivism by changing the
living conditions.

An area that continues to be illusive is outreach. The committee vies
outreach as the ability of an organization to communicate its programs to the
veteran. This means using all means available media, print, visual, oral, town
Hall meetings and any other programs developed at the local level to get the
word out. We have tremendous research being done but often the results of this
research is not being shared with the health care provides at the lowest level.
This much information is denied to the provider and the veteran. This area is
very weak and needs much intensified management and improvement.

During our visit to Green Bay we also discovered that capable Tribal
Veterans Service Officers (VSO’s) are not being employed because of a glitch in
",0,0,0,0
157,"the system that makes them temporary employees with the attendant lower pay.
While this is qualification driven, the serving staff persons are familiar with the
traditions and culture of the native population as well as the population in general
thereby enhancing the chances to have a successful program. This committee
will investigate the issue of VAO accreditation/certification as well as counselor
qualifications further. We will endeavor to clarify this issue and propose
solutions.
CONCLUSION:
The ACMV visit to Green Bay, Wisconsin was informative for members, Native
American veterans, and other individuals in attendance. The Committee’s visit to
the Oneida Reservation and conducting the THM proved beneficial to gaining a
comprehensive insight to the historical, cultural, socio-political and economic
survival of a people. Support of the efforts made by the Center for Minority
Veterans and ACMV to visit with the Oneida Nation was well received and
appreciated.
We would like to thank the Oneida Nation for its efforts to provide quality services
to its veterans as well as to all other veterans seeking assistance.
Special recognition is extended to the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs
for its leadership in addressing the issues of Native American Veterans and for
establishing the Tribal Coordinator position within the WDVA.
Subcommittee issues developed during this visit are as follows:
10
",0,0,0,0
158,"Subcommittee on Health Care

Recommend that the VA explore other potential civilian partnerships,

which could enhance the accessibility of primary health clinics for all

veterans.

e The Subcommittee is concerned with the disproportionate rate of PTSD in
minority veterans e.g., Native Americans (52-57%), Hispanics (33%), African
Americans (17-19%), and Asians (9%). The disproportionate numbers
suggest the need for a strong cultural influence in the clinical programs
designed to identify and treat minority patients with this diagnosis. The clinical
implications of these disproportionate numbers also strongly suggest the
urgent need for a clinical database that accounts for various minority
populations.

Recommend that the VA develop and implement an outreach / identification

program and a treatment program that is culturally sensitive to each of the

specific minority PTSD groups. Also recommend that the VA immediately
construct and implement a clinical data base which can distinctly identify
each of the minority populations within a clinical diagnosis.

e The Subcommittee commends the efforts of the Center for Minority Veterans
(CMV) to educate program coordinators at the 2""° Annual Minority Veterans
Program Coordinators’ Conference held on October 12-15, 1999, at the
DoubleTree in Crystal City, Virginia. This timely conference covered topics
such as conducting health fairs, getting the support of station directors,
expanding outreach efforts, identifying measurable and reportable care
standards, and sharing best practices.

Recommend that the annual Minority Veterans Coordinators’ Conference

continue to be funded and supported to ensure consistency in and

continuous improvement of all programs.

e The Subcommittee supports the new partnership with HCFA which will
identified alternative Healthcare financing opportunities for Category VII
veterans and their families. Information was distributed to MVPCs about
Medicare and Medicaid benefits, extended care programs for the aged or
disabled, and children and infant programs. Upcoming HCFA social worker
conferences will communicate the needs of Veterans and opportunities to
partner on a local level.

Recommend continued sharing of information and resources to provide the

most comprehensive program of Healthcare to our Veterans.

159,"e The Subcommittee congratulates Dr. Petzel (VISN Director based in MN) for
identifying a clinical access problem within his area and then setting clinical
access standards. The following access standards for all treatment facilities.

Recommend a primary care appointment within 30 days of a request.

Recommend a specialty care appointment within 30 days of a request.

Recommend a face to face meeting with the primary care giver within 30

minutes of the appointment time.

e The Subcommittee shared Dr. Cummings’ (VISN Director of 7 facilities in IL,
WI and Ml) concerns about the disproportionate number of minorities within
her geographic treatment area. As an example, she noted that 50% of the VA
patients in Chicago are African Americans and 70% of all substance abuse
patients are from a minority population. Dr Cummings’ concerns centered
around an unsuccessful outreach program, a staff that is not culturally
reflective of the patient population, clinical research programs that do not
address potential cultural differences, and a lack of patient education
programs that are culturally sensitive to minority populations. The
Subcommittee is gravely concerned about the treatment, educational, and
research implications of a VA staff that does not reflect the cultural diversity of
the patient population that it serves. Of particular concern is the lack of
culturally diverse primary care practitioners who are the first line of contact for
a patient seeking help. The Subcommittee’s recommendations fall into 3
basic categories clinical, education, and research.

Recommend that the VA, specifically the VISNs, ensure that the percentage

of minorities on an outreach staff and the primary care givers staff be

reflective of the percentages of minority patients within that geographic
treatment area. MVPC should be prepared to assist VISN directors in
designing programs to help to meet this standard with suggested minority
marketing and staff recruitment plans. Obstacles to adhering to this
standard should be elevated to the Washington office for assistance.

The VA should establish a cultural sensitivity review policy for each wide-

ranging educational program to ensure program success for all

populations. Additionally, VISNs should elicit the support of local religious
groups, veterans’ organizations and community programs to expand their
educational outreach and treatment patient database.

The VA should establish a cultural sensitivity review policy for each

research program undertaken in the future to ensure that the patient

database and therefore results are reflective of the patient population.
12
",0,0,0,0
160,"e The Subcommittee commends the Milwaukee VAMC director, Glen Grippen
for his strong support of his MVPC’s efforts to establish a professional and
paraprofessional staff distribution that is reflective of the racial make-up of
their patient population. The Subcommittee also applauds Mr. Grippen’s
patient care advances with the use of the electronic medical record, focus on
preventive medicine, use of nurse practitioners for primary care, and use of
tele-medicine for follow-up care. Even so, the Subcommittee cautions that
the cultural diversity of primary care providers, to include nurse practitioners,
must be reflective of the patient population. If not, they risk missing the
appropriate cultural nuances critical for accurate patient histories, patient
treatment plans, and family involvement in a supportive patient care
environment. Of further concern is that 30% of minority veterans do not have
a telephone which would preclude them being a viable candidate for tele-
medicine home care. This discrepancy could lead to skewing program
success rates. The Subcommittee has several recommendations related to
this discussion.

Recommend that all preventive medicine program initiatives include a

cultural sensitivity review to ensure the inclusion of all minority patient

populations.

Recommend that the number of primary care givers, to include nurse

practitioners staff, be reflective of the proportion of minority patients within

that geographic treatment area. This will help to ensure accurate patient
histories, as well as culturally sensitive patient treatment plans and family
involvement plans specific to each minority patient population group.

Recommend that all tele-medicine patient care programs include a

proportionate number of minority patients reflective of that geographical

area. If necessary, the VA should provide the telephone equipment needed
for equitable participation.

e The Subcommittee on Healthcare has not conducted any field visits since the
April 4-9, 1999 Puerto Rico fact-finding visit. The Subcommittee endorses the
opening of three additional clinics on the east end of the island which will
enhance Healthcare accessibility for all veterans in Puerto Rico. Still, the
Subcommittee notes with concern the lack of response to other critical
elements of the previous trip report. Therefore, the Subcommittee reiterates
the following recommendations and eagerly awaits proactive responses.

Recommend that the Under Secretary for Health establish an inpatient

PTSD program in Puerto Rico for veterans residing in the Caribbean region.

(Recommendation # 6, The Committee’s Fifth Annual Report)

Recommend that the Directors of the San Juan, Regional Office, and the

San Juan Medical Center, establish mandatory cultural sensitivity training

13
",0,0,0,0
161,"for employees at their facilities . The Assistant Secretary for Human

Resources and Administration and the Director, VA Center for Minority

Veterans, should assist in the development and implementation of the

training. (Recommendation #8, The Committee’s Fifth Annual Report)

Recommend that the San Juan Regional Office, and Director, San Juan VA

Medical Center, conduct more veterans’ information forums and town hall

meetings in both Puerto Rico and the USVI. The MVPCs at these facilities

should be an integral part of the planning and actual execution of town hall
meetings and information forums. We applaud the appointment of a half
time coordinator at St. Thomas and wish for a comparable appointment or
optimally a full time appointment at the San Juan facility.

(Recommendation #10, The Committee’s Fifth Annual Report.) Additionally

the Subcommittee recommends that such meetings include a major

healthcare element for general patient education and preventive medicine
specifically geared to minority populations.

e The Subcommittee notes with concern an issue raised at the Oneida Nation
Veterans town hall meeting. A Native American Veteran spoke of a patient
who claims that he had not been informed of his responsibility for a financial
co-payment of care received at a Veterans hospital. The patient’s treatment
bill was eventually referred to a collection agency.

Recommend that all VA treatment facilities document disclosure of a

patient’s responsibility for co-payment of fees for care. Also recommend

that public forums and town hall meetings proactively inform the
perspective patient populations of the financial responsibilities of patient
care.

e The Subcommittee notes with great concern the patient care issues raised by
the June 7-10, 1998 visit to Waco and Temple, Texas.

Recommend a revisit by the Healthcare Subcommittee to document the

status of suggested changes noted in the 1998 report to improve the

patient care of minority veterans.

e The Subcommittee also expresses concern for the status of healthcare
provided to minority veterans who reside in the flood-ravaged regions of North
Carolina. Anecdotal evidence suggests that minority veterans residing in
outlying areas are having difficulty accessing timely healthcare services.

Recommend a Subcommittee field visit to this area if the preliminary

investigations warrant an on site visit.

e Given the large proportion of minority Veterans living in metropolitan areas,
the Subcommittee expresses concern for the status of healthcare provided

14
",0,0,0,0

Newark NJ; and San Francisco, CA.
Recommend on-site visits to these densely populated minority veteran
areas to assess the availability, quality, and appropriateness of the VA
Healthcare provided.

e The Subcommittee continues to express concern about the status of
healthcare available to Minority Veterans now living in the Philippines.
Recommend an on site visit to the Philippines to assess the availability,
quality, and appropriateness of the VA Healthcare provided to minority

veterans.

",0,0,0,0
163,"Subcommittee on Outreach
During the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans’ meeting in Green

Bay, Wisconsin, October 27-29, 1999, guest speakers made the following key

points that related to the role of the Outreach Subcommittee:

e The Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs (WDVA) plans to purchase a
mobile van to take services to veterans living in rural and outlying areas. This
“rolling clinic” would be a full-service unit that would be set up to enroll
veterans for health care and other entitlements and, at the same time, provide
basic health-care services.

e WDVA works closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs in partnering
together as a “single network” when reaching out to veterans. This lessens
the confusion on the veterans’ part as to who is responsible for what,
streamlines the delivery of services, speaks to the veterans with a “single
voice” on veterans’ matters, and avoids duplication of effort. (From the
veterans’ perspective, whether the servicing agency is at the federal or state
level is not a concern to the veterans as long as the receive their benefits.)

e WDVA also makes a constant effort to educate the state’s top political officials
about veterans’ issues. This educational awareness is vital especially
awareness is vital especially since the number of veterans in top political and
decision-making positions Is steadily decreasing.

e WDVA conducts a major outreach program at state fairs and community
events, where information is provided to veterans who may be unaware of
veterans’ benefits and programs. At the state fair, veterans representing the
federal and state governments and American Indian tribes are o hand at the
booths to provide information.

e The Oneida Nation’s sharing agreement with the Department of Veterans
Affairs calls for the clinic on the reservation to provide health-care services to
veterans living on the reservation. The clinic in turn bills the DVA for services
provided. This highly successful arrangement is a great service to the
veterans.

e Milwaukee’s homeless program called Vets Central (check name) —
supported by the WDVA’s Veterans Assistance Program — provides
temporary shelter for homeless veterans. At this facility, veterans have the
opportunity for job training and networking to help them in their job search.

By providing these services and a temporary home. Vets Central gives
veterans self-worth that help them to re-build their lives.
16
",0,0,0,0
164,"e Because Category 7 veterans (non-service connected) have been turned
away by VA in the past, there is difficulty in re-building their confidence in
order to get them to enroll in VA facilities.

e Veterans service organizations are also having trouble getting the work out to
their members and other veterans.

The Outreach Subcommittee recommends that:

e The Department of Veterans Affairs should use the WDVA’s single-network
system in reaching out to veterans as a model for other states to follow in
improving their respective outreach programs. The outstanding partnership of
the Department of Veterans Affairs and the WDVA at the local level has
shown that outreach to veterans can be streamlined into a much more
effective system in the delivery of services.

e The Secretary encourage VA facilities to use the Oneida Nation’s sharing
agreement as a model in developing similar arrangements in order to provide
veterans living in outlying areas easier accessibility to health care. A value-
added benefit could likely be that the clinics used in these arrangements
would be more aware of any cultural sensitivity, thus easing veterans’
trepidation about receiving treatment.

e The Secretary should encourage DVA Directors and Chief operating Officers
with state politicians, county commissioners and decision-makers to educate
them about veterans’ issues. This educational awareness is especially critical
as the number of veterans in key political and decision-making positions
steadily decreases. Therefore, the paucity of those with firsthand knowledge
of veterans’ matters could greatly affect state legislation to appropriate
funding for veterans’ programs.

e The Secretary should encourage a sharing agreement with Indian Health
Service which calls for outreach clinic on the reservation to provide health-
care services to veterans living on the reservation. The Indian Health Service
in turn bills the DVA for services provided.

e The Secretary brief Miss America 2000, Heather Renee French — whose
platform is campaigning for homeless veterans issues — about minority
veterans so that she is fully aware that minorities make up a significant
number of the homeless veteran population. As Miss French makes her Miss
America visits across the country, the visibility of her position and her
influence would highlight the plight of homeless veterans, especially minority
veterans, who often hesitate to seek assistance. With Miss French's efforts,
those alienated from the mainstream of society can hopefully be brought back
into the fold.

areas where a high percentage of minority veterans live in outlying areas and

Overview:

The Committee decided to request that DVA provide periodic updates on its
progress in resolving issues and recommendations presented by the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans. During deliberations, it was determined that
several recommendations were still pending action by VA. The Committee has
made 111 recommendations, 18 remain open and 5 are directed to other Federal
agencies. After careful review, the committee confirms that the 18
recommendations are still valid and need to be acted on.

The eighteen (18) open recommendations are as follows:

Second Annual Report Recommendations: Three remain open

Number 3. Recognize the appropriate regional and National minority
organizations that serve our country’s diverse population groups and invite
them as genuine partners, consultants, advisors and expert witnesses in
enriching the Department’s commitment to serve the needs of minority
veterans.

Number 7 Direct that ethnic identifiers be included immediately on all
appropriate Department application forms, particularly the initial
application form completed by all veterans, and be correlated with
Department of Defense manpower files and the revisions to the Office of
Management and Budget Directive #15.

Number 9 . Authorize and fund a five-member Minority Veterans Review
Commission (MVRC), chaired by the Chairman, Advisory Committee on
Minority Veterans, with consultative authority and staff support to conduct
a series of focus meetings with minority veterans and organizations across
the country, to include the Pacific, to determine the blueprint of needs and
concerns, as well as recommendations, of all our minority veterans and
followed by a conference on the west coast, in the Midwest, and on the
east coast to report the findings to our minority veterans. Their report
would be presented to you for concurrence and advocacy by 1 March
1998.

Third Annual Report -- Seven remain open.

Number 3 Develop performance rating standards for all VA

management personnel (facility directors) that include rating factors to
19
",0,0,0,0
167,"measure outreach, equality of services, and support to minority veteran
programs.

Number 7 Establish wellness clinic outreach programs on Indian
reservations.

Number 15 Replicate at other locations around the country the models of
the Center for Aging that is being constructed at Tripler Hospital.

Number 18 Initiate activities to insure more standardization of computer
systems, and eligibility requirements throughout the VA.

Number 28 Investigate the claim by minority veterans that there are
“inconsistencies in rating board decisions for PTSD.”

Number 34 Review the SBA veteran loan program and identify obstacles
experienced by veterans trying to start businesses.

Number 57 VA should identify tribal veterans representatives to attend
the National Veterans Training Institute / Disabled American Veterans
Service Officers Academy, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado, to
become certified claims representatives for Indian veterans.

Fifth Annual Report Recommendations:

Number .1l appointments, patient privacy, primary care teams management,
pharmaceutical services, medical claims reimbursement, beneficiary
travel, and implementation of eligibility reform guidance.

Number. Acting Under Secretary for Health establish an inpatient PTSD
program in Puerto Rico for veterans residing in the Caribbean region.

Number Directors of the San Juan, VA Regional Office, and the San Juan
VA Medical Center establish mandatory cultural sensitivity training for
employees at their facilities. The Assistant Secretary for Human
Resources and Administration and the Director, VA Center for Minority
Veterans, should assist in the development and implementation of the
training.

Number. Director, VA Medical Center San Juan, appoint a working group to
address and resolve the concerns of blind veterans. The working group
should also focus on recommending the best location for ophthalmology
services for blind veterans who reside in Puerto Rico.

",0,0,0,0
168,"In addition to the 18 recommendations that are outstanding, the committee
recommends that:

-The Secretary works out an agreement with the Indian Health Service to
provide proper medical care to veterans on a cost reimbursable basis.
-Outreach programs at all levels be expanded, improved and managed by
senior officials until the desired results are achieved.
-The issue of service to Puerto Rican Veterans is escalated so that the
Secretary working with the congress can develop solutions. The
committee recognizes that service to Puerto Rican Veterans is tied to a
larger political issue.
-Increase the business being contracted from minority and women
veterans owned businesses.
-Continue to seek ways to deliver service to veterans living in remote
areas.

Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
Minutes of Meeting
October 26-29, 1999
Green Bay, WI
The following minutes reflect the business conducted during the meeting:
TUESDAY
October 26, 1999
Members of the ACMV traveled to Green Bay, Wisconsin.
WEDNESDAY
October 27, 1999
Mr. Gary Metoxen, member of the ACMV, provided introductory remarks and a
brief history of the Oneida Nation. Following, Mr. Gerald Danforth, President /
Chairman of the Oneida Nation welcomed the ACMV to the reservation.
The Chairman of the ACMV called the meeting to order at 8:15 a.m. Minutes of
the previous May 12-14, 1999, were approved. Introductions of current
committee members as well as new committee members were conducted. The
Director for the ACMV provided an update of center activities. Mr. Hensley
announced that a signed agreement with the Oneida Nation allowing all veterans
use of the Oneida Nation Health Care Clinic was in effect. He reiterated the
need for additional service centers given the most recent statistics on Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among Minority veterans. Statistics include
52-57% for Native Americans, 33% for Hispanic Americans, 17-19% for African
Americans and 9% for Asian Americans.
Mr. Raymond G. Boland, Secretary, Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs
(WDVA) welcomed the ACMV on behalf of Governor Tommy Thompson.
Secretary Boland provided an update on federal law and Department of Defense
regulations governing the use of vacant and unused facilities for homeless
veterans programs. He noted that minority veterans do not apply for
compensation benefits at the same rate as majority veterans. Secretary Boland
announced that Governor Thompson had signed legislation establishing the
29
",0,0,0,0
177,"position of Tribal Coordinator for the WDVA. This position will report to the
Secretary and be responsible for all coordination and future initiatives among and
between the numerous Native American tribes residing in Wisconsin.
THURSDAY
October 28, 1999
Dr. Robert A. Petzel, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN 13) provided an
overview of services within the VISN. Covering seven states in the upper
mid-west region, much of which is rural, he indicated that Native American
constitute the largest minority within the VISN. Dr. Petzel highlighted new goals
for increased access to Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) and
stressed that access to care continues to be the number one problem within
VISN 13. Under Dr. Petzel'’s leadership, the number of CBOC’s has increased,
appointments are within 30 days of request and veterans are seen within 20
minutes of the scheduled appointment.
Dr. Joan Cummings, Director, VISN 12, indicated her difficulty in recruiting
minority staff comparable to the minority patient population within the VISN. She
indicated that 70% of substance abuse patients are minorities. Homeless
veterans constitute a critical problem for the VISN especially when minority
veterans/patients are reluctant to participate in research projects. Research fairs
have been conducted to address the problem. Dr. Cummings indicated the use
of tele-home visits and computerized tele-medicine visits to enhance follow-up
care for patients in remote areas. However, 30% of minority patients do not have
telephones and are ineligible for care. VISN 12 has conducted various surveys
on the quality of care, but Dr. Cummings indicated the results are not racially
sensitive.
Mr. Glenn Grippen, Director, Milwaukee VA Medical Center (VAMC), highlighted
outreach efforts to un-served and underserved veterans in his area. He indicated
that the agreement between the medical center and the Oneida Nation to provide
veteran with care at the Oneida Health Clinic is considered a model program.
Mr. Grippen indicated that their tele-medicine program is expanding in the areas
of home-care and CBOC’s. Concern about VA downsizing has adversely
affected the recruitment and retention of minority staff members within the
medical center.
Mr. John Keil, Special Assistant to the Director, VA Regional Office (VARO),
spoke to the issue of involvement with the Oneida Nation in establishing a
Veterans Service Officer program. He indicated outreach efforts with other
Wisconsin Native Americans were conducted through numerous town hall
meetings and planned activities. He plans more outreach activities during 2000.
Additional staff is needed to serve the minority veterans population within the
VARO.

30
",0,0,0,0
178,"A Town Hall Meeting (THM) was conducted with ACMV members listening to and

addressing concerns of the 40 Native American veterans in attendance.

Veterans participating in the THM represented numerous Native American tribes

throughout Wisconsin.

(a) ISSUE: Need for a sharing agreement between each Indian reservation.

(b) ISSUE: Need for sharing agreement between Indian Health Service and
the Veterans Administration in order to provide effective health services to
all veterans.

(c) ISSUE: Lack of explicit communication in explaining fees associated with
health services.

(d) ISSUE: Need to restore confidence for category 7 veterans (non-service
connected) who have been turned away for veteran services in the past.

e Review of previous minutes by Anthony Hawkins. The minutes were
approved as read.

e Federal Advisory Committee Act briefing by Anthony Hawkins. In 1972, the
law established19 committees. It also provided oversight for the committees,
and ensured standards & operating procedures and public participation.
About 1,000 committees are now chartered. Meetings must be announced in
the Federal Register at least 15 days before the meeting and must be open to
the public. This committee is exempt from signing financial disclosure
documents. The committee is required to submit an annual report through
the Secretary to the Congress.

e Review of Protocol and Operating Procedures by Anthony Hawkins. A copy
of these procedures is available in the meeting workbooks. The ACMV has
18 public members diverse by race, gender, geographical region, and 5 ex-
officio members to include representatives from the Secretary of Defense;
Health and Human Services, Labor; Commerce; and the office of the Under

33
",0,0,0,1
181,"Secretary for Benefits & for Health. ACMV was extended and funded until
2003.

e CMV Update by the director, Mr. Willie Hensley. The next Coordinators
training conference will be in Pittsburgh, PA on October 15-19, 2000.
Although we do not have money in the budget for a conference this year,
HCFA (Health Care Finance Administration) will provide $150,000 and we will
receive support from the VA Learning University. For the year 2001, the CMV
hopes to sponsor its first Summit for Minority Veterans, with breakout
sessions for individual races. Planning begins in the next 30 days. They
have requested about $200,000 in funds in the current budget and expect 800
veterans. The women veterans’ office will host a summit this summer. The
CMV will present to the coordinators a model outreach plan for Diabetes and
encourage coordinators to sponsor health fairs. Additionally, the CMV will
host a Health conference July 20th-21st in West Palm Beach and will publish
a directory of the coordinators for Service Organizations and veteran groups.
The HCFA partnership is geared to educating veterans about their Medicare
options (4,000 veterans were contacted last year and 1,500 thus far this
year). Culturally sensitive PSAs (Public Service Announcements) will be
coming out for diabetes, digestive and kidney diseases. This program is
under the auspices of the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive, and
Kidney Diseases. Initiatives with clinical trails that started with the CMV will
be expanded to all veterans soon. Other partnerships include those with the
National Cancer Institute; the American GI Forum; and the Indian Health
Services. Access to medical care in the Oneida Sharing Agreement includes
contract health care on the Uintah/Ouray Indian Reservation; and other
agreements. Outpatient clinics are now operational in Sells, & Ganado AZ
and Riverton, WY, and Glasgow ,

Dr. Richie, ACMV member, shared a new book that can serve as a resource
for medical clinics/inpatient wards and VA offices: Culture & Nursing Care: A
Pocket Guide by Juliene G. Lipson, Suzanne L. Dibble and Pamela A.
Minarik; UCSF Nursing Press ISBN # 0-943671-15-9. It is available for $21.95
+ $6.00 UPS by calling 415-476-4992.

e CMV (Center for Minority Veterans) Program Initiatives: The CMV published
the demographic compensation & pension study; enhanced the CMV’s
Website to establish links to other groups; and promoted minority veteran
owned businesses by meeting with these businesses to educate them and
notify them of pending contracts. The CMV has been authorized two (2)
additional staff positions. The Centers objective is to increase the diversity of
the staff. The CMV has a schedule of conference calls that are used to keep
the veteran community more informed of what is going on and to receive
feedback from the field on how our policies are being received and
implemented. The CMV is seeking more involvement from VSOs. To assess
the effectiveness of the Minority Veterans Program Coordinators programs

34
",0,0,0,0
182,"(MVPCs) they are now required to submit an annual report to the CMV. This
policy is an outgrowth of the Secretary's memorandum of support of this
program. The CMV continues to serve as the conscience of the DVA insofar
as minority veterans are concerned. The CMV staff encourages all to receive
culturally competent health care training.

e CMV Activities include VHA EEO/Special emphasis program managers’
training; VBA Opportunity 2000 training program; Day of Honor 2000 project;
Pacific American Veterans Roll Call of Honor; Hispanic Summit Il; Navajo
Veterans Summit; Native American Repatriation conference; and the Pacific
Asian American training conference.

e Secretary Togo West’s Remarks: The Secretary thanked the ACMV members
and the CMV for their commitment to veterans. He noted that the FY2001
budget has the largest percentage increase in VA discretionary funding to
include a $1.5 billion increase with $20.3 million for healthcare (this is the
largest part of the increase). He also noted a $109 million dollar increase in
the budget for claims processing and an increase in staffing of 586 people for
this year. This increase combined with the 400-person increase from last
year resulted in over 1,000 additional personnel in claims processing within
the past year 556,000 veterans died last year (an average of 1500/day),
which increases the pressure to provide more cemetery space. They now
have six new cemeteries in the planning stages. May 25th was a Day of
Honor for WWII veterans and the Secretary attended a White House
ceremony to sign a joint resolution recognizing that day. Secretary West
asked the ACMV to provide suggestions on how to celebrate this day in the
years to come. Secretary West expressed the hope that with the additional
budget funding, he would see an increase in access of patients to services
and an increase in the access of Minority Veterans Program Coordinators to
see their directors. He emphasized that the MVP and MVPC coordinator’s
work results in enhance delivery of service for all veterans. The Secretary
encouraged the committee to be vigilant in reviewing the responses of the
various VA services to ensure that the responses address the issues head on
and do not skirt the issues. Secretary West reminded the committee that our
work is important to the direction VA will go in the future.

e Status of SACMV (Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans)
Report by Anthony Hawkins: Of the 111 recommendations made since 1995,
18 remain open and five were directed to other Federal agencies. Second
annual report: #3 remains open and ongoing, to increase the number of VSOs
to be in partnership; #7 directs that ethnic background be identified on all
applications---it is still in negotiation to identify which forms need to be
changed (need OMB approval); # 9 authorized and funded a MVC review
committee to meet with and report on meetings with vets-- this
recommendation will be met with the summit. Third annual report July 1997
with 63 recommendations: 7 recommendations are still open; #3 develops

35
",0,0,0,0
183,"performance rating standards that address support of minority vet programs—
this is being fought by some in the VA line officers group; #7 establishes
Indian Health Clinics and this is being done; #15 recommendation of the
replication of the model for the center for aging at Tripler at other centers--;
#18 recommends standardization of computer systems to ensure consistent
data collection (this is an ongoing recommendation). #28 investigate the
claim of inconsistencies of compensation of PTSD by race and ethnicity.
Recommendation #34 reviews the SBA veteran loan program to see if there
are problems (referred to the SBA) that may be addressed by PL 106.50.
Reference recommendation #57, which was referred to the DOL to ensure the
reinstitution of VSO training institute in Colorado for native Americans.
Accreditation and certification (phase one has started, phase two is due on
board by December and will eventually be four levels) are two different issues
and a problem with compensation for their time was referred to the sub-
committee for follow-up (and investigation of disparities in pay grades).

e Hershel Gober, Deputy Secretary briefing. The deputy welcomed the new
committee members and commended the committee for their hard work. He
expressed appreciation for all outreach efforts and encouraged the committee
to focus on opportunities to contact new veterans. The Deputy emphasized
the “One VA Concept” regarding veteran benefits, healthcare and cemetery
services. The Deputy reported that a “smart card” pilot plan is due to him not
later that August of this year. The card would contain the basic medical
information on the veteran and would facilitate receiving care at any VA
medical center. The Committee asked to be kept informed on this project.
This could be a valuable tool to be used by Minority Veterans.

e Research Update Cardiac Care & Stroke Risk by Claire Maklan, Ph.D. Chief
Scientific Development, Health Services Research & Development Service.
Special populations include those who have been historically disadvantaged.
Documented variations in treatments include fewer diagnostic therapeutic
procedures and more hysterectomies and amputations. 1997 they invited
research which would explain the disparities in care and not just describe
them. The call for new research also encouraged the use of multiple
research methods to include qualitative research. Research challenges
include sample size, cost and language barriers. Since 1987, 24 proposals
have been reviewed, with 10 studies funded, $6.3 million committed and 3
studies completed. Results showed that fewer African American veterans get
knee and hip replacements than white veterans with comparable symptoms
and that Hispanics and whites are similar in their reaction to diabetes. A
Research Experience Program provides grants and money to students and
faculty to encourage more minority folks to go into the research field. Annual
updates can be found at the website. The ACMV noted with great concern
the research finding which showed that the VA used full abdominal surgical
cuts for African Americans who need cholecystectomies (removal of gall
bladder) instead of laparoscopies (minimal abdominal incisions) procedures

36
",0,0,0,0
184,"which is provided to most white veterans. This has implications, which lean
toward discrimination of care. The ACMV noted the need for a mechanism to
disseminate research findings such as these to the VISNs and medical
centers and a mechanism to hold physicians accountable for reviewing the
findings to determine their applicability to their facility and if necessary,
correcting the problems identified. Web site www.va.gov/resdev.

e Minority Health Care lssues—Global Assessment HHS briefed by H. Kelly,
DDS (dentist & public health officer). The Office of Minority Health started
with the realization that African Americans disproportionately experienced a
higher death rate. It started with 20 people and a $5 million dollar budget in a
central office and now is disseminated throughout the HHS system. Now has
a 50 million-dollar budget with 60 people (2-3 in 10 regional offices). They
“prime the pump.” They work with their sister programs to change the content
of programs to ensure that there is minority participation. Minorities
disproportionately experience disease, disability and death. Minorities also
wait longer than others to seek care. Provider stream is not culturally
sensitive to patients. Focusing on five goals that deal with cancer,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, HIV and immunizations. These deal with
personal practices by the patient. They are victims of cultural, ethnic and
racial biases. The website is http://www.omh.gov . Blueprints are coming out
in November to spell out how to dispel the disparities in these areas. We need
better and closer coordination between the ACMV and Center for Minority
Health Care on issues of mutual interest.

e Board of Veterans Appeals Status Report briefed by the Chairman, Judge
Clark. Hearings being driven by technology such as hearings being done by
video conferencing. Some disabilities preclude the veterans traveling to a
distant board site. Video conferencing also used for teaching purposes.
Board members are appointed by the Secretary and approved by the
President. Announced a tele-commuting program for appeal lawyers to
attract new folks and allow them to be competitive. Committee reported
anecdotal evidence that there is a difference in time (longer) to adjudicate a
minority veterans claim versus white veterans. Mr. Clarke does not have any
data that supports this perception. He also noted that the remand rate is now
29% and includes remands because of changes in the law, which happen
during the processing time. The Committee noted the difficulty of veterans
conveying their feelings using a translator and asked about the Hispanic
make up of the Board. Judge Clark reported that one judge is a native
Hispanic. The Committee recommended that there be more minority
representation on the board and that they consider a mobile appeals board
that would take the services to the veteran. Judge Clark noted the difficulty of
producing an appeal board judge (10-15 years of experience as an appeals
attorney). A visitor noted the inequity in pay for appeals judges and social
security administrative law judges (ALJs). Judge Clark noted that he is
constantly comparing pay scales and benefits so that he remains competitive.

37
",0,0,0,0
185,"This was initially corrected through public law passed a few years ago. The
Committee recommends parity in pay d benefits for the Board of Veterans
Appeals board members.

e Diversity Training Briefing by Francisco lvarra, Vice Chair. The Minority
Veterans Committee of the Seattle Regional Office developed a training
program for rating specialist that focused on cultural sensitivity.

Tuesday June 6, 2000

e Hepatitis C Infections briefed by Dr. Toni Mitchell, Chief Consultant: Most
new cases are usually from active IV drug users (numbers dropped 90%),
although it can be gotten from a one time use 20 years ago or exposure to
blood products. Need to educate providers since now it takes 8-9 visits
before the patient is correctly diagnosed. Need a stronger outreach program
to get veterans tested who may have this disease. However, for category/
patients there is a disincentive because insurance companies would be
notified of the results. The disease can be aggressive or slow growing. Must
be abstinent from alcohol for six months and drug free to be eligible for
clinical trials. VA has established a clinical council on Hepatitis C. Indian
Health service has not been testing for HIV or HCV because it is too
expensive. This is morally reprehensible. African Americans and Hispanics
have a higher rate of infection and do not respond to therapies as well as
whites. The committee suggested using stand-downs to reach veterans for
testing and counseling. 62% of all of those who test positive are of the
Vietnam Era so those veterans are targeted for testing. 40-60% of the prison
system inmates are positive for HCV. A social stigma (especially in a small
community) goes with this diagnosis causing a barrier to testing. With
veteran patients, there is little crossover between HIV and HCV. Veterans
should be eligible for disability while undergoing treatment (1-2 years). The
outreach and public relations aspect this program needs improvement. We
are not preparing minority veterans for participation in much needed studies.

e VBA Update Road Map to Excellence briefed by Mr. Joe Thompson, Under
Secretary for Benefits. The statistics on Minority Veterans presentation is
new and they’ve haven't had much time to analyze all of the material.
Roughly the same percentage for troops composition and compensation
claims. Home loans data shows participation in VA program but little
participation in the Fannie Mae and Fannie Mack programs. Education loans
show about the same percentage of use for white, black, Hispanic and other
(57.2%-52.7%). Vocational programs show significantly higher rates of use.
Mostly those at 20% disability minimum although they will consider those with
a 10% disability (and there is a ten year limit which can be appealed).
Converting to VGLI upon separation is cost prohibitive. While on active duty
91-96% of each group take the SGLI insurance. VBA outreach efforts for
minority veterans include bi-lingual counselors, pamphlets, and applications

38
",0,0,0,0
186,"as well as putting information online. The committee recommends using
alternative job experience instead of masters in education requirement for
vocational rehabilitation counselor positions so that more minority persons
can qualify. This is very important when trying to staff positions in remote
areas.

e Online application (VONAPP-veterans on-line application website) briefed by

. This will be up in July 2000. You have 30 days to
complete the form each time you sign on and make a change in the data. If
you do not work on the application within a 30-day window, the application will
be deleted. The time allows you to stop and research information required.
Two forms to include compensation & pension and the vocational
rehabilitation form. The committee noted that this program presupposes that
supporting documents will be provided to it’s veteran in a timely fashion.

e Cardiac Care Program Evaluation & Education Program Evaluation briefed by
Mr. Gary Steinberg, DAS for Planning and Evaluation. There are statutory
requirements for evaluation and third party independent assessments of
emerging concerns; efficiency & effectiveness; costs; customer participation
and satisfaction; organizational alignment and future needs of veterans and
their families. 1998-2001 evaluations include education programs
(Montgomery GI bill); cardiac care survivor benefits; prosthetics.

e Education Program evaluation briefed by Dr. M. Habibbion. Problems with
evaluations include disproportionately low numbers of minorities who
participated in the survey. For example, of the 7,000 Asians who used the Gl
bill, only 117 were located and of them only 23 agreed to participate in the
study. Study results showed that African Americans had the most problems
finding a job after military service and that they reported that this was related
to a lack of proper skills. 45% of AA enrolled in two year programs as
opposed to Hispanics or whites who opted four year academic programs.
22% of AA veterans attended private colleges as opposed to 10% of
Hispanics and whites.

e Cardiac Care Overview briefed by Dr. M. Amesquita. Concern was
expressed by the committee that there be minority participation of the work
group. Questions also concerned the source of the ethnic data. The SOW
requires analysis of outcomes by race and generally accepted ethnic
characteristics.

e Veteran Identity Study briefed by Dr. Nancy Harada and Dr. Donna
Washington reported on focus groups stratified on war cohort (WWII &
Korea/Vietnam/Gulf War) and race/ethnicity for 4 groups (not enough money
to include Native Americans). Content of the discussions included military
experience and use of VA services. Total 178 participants in the study. Movie
shows excerpts from the different group meetings. Major themes include:

39
",0,0,0,0
187,"customer service; benefits information & access; medical care (quality and
waiting time for an appointment & at the site); VA services; and convenience.
Findings showed that race-ethnicity and veteran identity has an impact on
perceptions of VA healthcare and Veteran identity frames expectations of the
VA i.e., expectation that veterans deserve special privilege from the VA and in
a manner that acknowledges their contribution and background. Dr. Harada
noted that with their findings, they hope to design an intervention model.
Such strategies might include education of employees as to the experiences
of veterans by race/ethnicity and guidelines for incorporation into clinical care.
The committee strongly recommends that the Native Americans be included
as a group and that the study group ensures that the findings are
disseminated and used by the providers. The committee also recommends
that this study be fully funded on a priority basis.

e Interface of VA computer systems briefed by Antonio Davila ACMV member.
He expressed concern with veterans filing computerized claims without the
benefit of VSO counseling. Health E-VET is a new program where veterans
will be able to input information into a virtual vault. This will be launched in
about two years. He also noted that Public Law 106-50 puts funds in the
Small Business Administration for veterans to launch businesses.

e National Cemetery Administration briefed by Mr. Vincent Barile, Deputy Under
Secretary for Management. They bear all of the costs once the Veterans
(and family member) enters the gate. National military cemeteries are not all
run by the VA. Three categories of cemeteries include open with in-ground
burial or cremation available; cremation only is where there is no room for a
casket; closed is still available for a second family member burial. Idaho is
the only state without a veteran cemetery either national or state. Four
programs include burial space; grants for state veteran cemeteries; furnish
headstones & markers; and administer the Presidential Memorial Certificate
program (you can get new ones from the most recent president). Their
strategy is to develop new cemeteries; extend the service life of existing
cemeteries; and encourage states to build veterans cemeteries. If both are
veterans, they are entitled to individual spaces and individual markers. There
is no restriction on the number of spouses you can have buried with you.

New construction of a national cemetery takes 5-7 years. The committee
asked if there was any way that a cemetery could discriminate against
minority veterans. They were told no the system operates on a first come first
serve basis.

e Alaska Update briefed by George Bennett, ACMV member. He noted the
difficulties of obtaining healthcare because of the size of the State, which
requires air transport or long trips by ground/ferry vehicles. He also noted
that there are many isolated communities, which make it difficult to reach all
veterans. Native American veterans in the southeast are starting to get
organized as a group to support each other and become a force to be

with two stops, one in the South and the other in the Northern part of the
State. The committee needs to be more fully informed on the many issues
facing veterans in the state of Alaska.

Wednesday June 7, 2000

e Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization briefed by Ms.
Wagner. There are 25 million small businesses in the country. Federal
dollars are used to help small businesses get started because banks don't
believe it is profitable to provide startup monies. The VA’s Procurement
budget is 5 billion dollars with 500 million for small businesses, $300 million
for women, $75 million with . HUB zone program gets the monies to
disadvantaged companies. Contract bundling has eroded small business
opportunities. Public Law 105.135 says that the SBA will establish a program
to help veterans—the VBOP (Veterans business outreach program) in four
locations (VA, FL, TX, and __). It also had them survey each agency to see
what they have done to help the Veterans; however, the survey has not been
started yet. Service disabled minority veterans have a funded program to
assist them in starting a business. The Chair noted that we must guard
against being satisfied with the 10% syndrome. We need to do more in this
arena. The committee also expressed concern that there does not seem to
be support at the highest level for the SBA’s minority veteran programs
except for information management and facilities management. The Chair
noted unawareness throughout the VA and throughout the agencies about the
use of minority small business owners. He recommended more face-to-face
meetings with the principles. We believe it would be money will spent to have
a small business conference for contrasting officers and small business
owners.

e Status of Puerto Rican Veterans briefed by MG(R) William Navas (here
on behave of Herb Brown). He represents 4 million citizens who are
disenfranchised and living in Puerto Rico. They have fewer benefits than the
draft dodger that left the country and later returned to the US. He is
attempting to get the Congress to sanction options, which will allow Puerto
Rico to become a full-fledged state or to grant it independence. Benefits they
do not have include the following: they cannot vote for the president; they do
not have senators, or congressional representatives, or an ambassador; and
although they do not pay taxes, their sons were drafted. By not acting on this,
the Congress is perpetuating racism. It should also be noted that about 45%
of the folks in Puerto Rico support a political party, which wants to keep the
status quo (not making a decision). The committee thanked MG (Ret) Navas
for his very informative briefing. We are aware of the plight of Puerto Rican
Veterans and addressed this issue in report number 5. Our recommendation
remains unchanged.

4]
",0,0,0,0
189,"e Office of Public Affairs Minority Outreach Plan briefed by Mr. Scheer.
They have put together a database of minority media outlets that can be
accessed by zip code or racial/ethnic category. The New York regional office
takes key VA stories to the national media for dissemination. The Dallas
regional office spearheads work with the Spanish media contacts and
translates info sheets. Soon starting an online subscription service to access
news release, Q&A sheet, and other information. They provide field support
packages to PAOs at the medical facilities. One key issue they are dealing
with now includes Hepatitis C. They now have a tool kit for use by PAOs,
which thanks veterans for their service. The Veterans benefits book has been
translated into Spanish but they have not had the funds to publish this. The
committee recommends that the PAO be funded to publish the benefits
book in Spanish and in sufficient quantity for our Hispanic veterans.
The Korean Veteran War commemoration has begun and will go for three
years. The committee recommends that the VA HQS PAO provide to the
field PAOs guidelines for a targeted communications plan that
correlates the five basic VA Healthcare goals as they apply to the
minority community. Additionally the PAQ’s will assist in disseminating
the information about small business loans for minority businesses.

e Issues for the next meeting as briefed by General Price, ACMV Chair.
We need to think about how to deal with veterans who do not have a personal
stake in getting well because they would loose their disability benefits. We
need to review the legal definition of Veteran to be sure it has kept up with our
national strategy as it concerns use of Reserve component force. Under the
current system reserve component forces could be mobilized for short periods
of time, i.e. 90 to 120 days, and not qualify for VA benefits after
demobilization because of the short period of time they served. We need to
make recommendations to change the law so those veterans are not
penalized. Mr. Hensley will share success stories of retroactive disability
claims at the next meeting. Mr. Hensley introduced a new staff member, Bill
Reyes who will help with database management. He also thanked Mr.
Livingston, American Legion; Mr. Fleming, Dept of Commerce, and Mr.
Edward Chow, of the office of Planning and Analysis. Mr. Hensley presented
certificates of appointment signed by Secretary West to the committee
members.

e The meeting was adjourned at 1112 hours.

Committee on Minority Veterans
Seventh Annual Report

July 1, 2001

Introduction

The Committee held its first meeting of the fiscal year in November 2000
at the VA Regional Office and Medical Center in Wilmington, DE. The
Committee also traveled to Philadelphia to receive briefings on ongoing programs
and current operations and had an opportunity to tour the Philadelphia VA
Regional Office and Insurance Center. The second meeting was convened in
April 2001 at the VA Central Office in Washington, DC. This meeting was
scheduled in Washington to allow the Committee to meet with the newly
appointed Secretary and new senior officials.

This year, the Committee continued to focus its reviews on topics both
internal and external to VA, addressing a variety of concerns having significant
impact on all veterans, but specifically matters facing the minority veteran
communities.

Since our last report, the Committee has undergone some transformation.
Sadly, one member, Mr. Talmadge C. Foster died in July 2000. Two members,
General Fred A. Gorden and Mr. Otho Lister, resigned for personal and
professional reasons. We thank them for their service on the Committee. We
welcomed four new members, Ms. Lourdes Alvarado-Ramos, Mr. Ralph Cooper,
Ms. Kim Pignatiello, and Dr. Roselyn J. Rice.

We want to thank the Directors and employees of the VA Wilmington and
Philadelphia centers for their support during our meeting and those individuals
who made presentations and provided information or data to the Committee
during this year’s meetings. Our sincere thanks is also extended to the Center
for Minority Veterans staff for their administrative support and assistance on
Committee activities.

192,"General Overview

This is the Seventh Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans. The Committee conducted two mandatory meetings as required by
Title 38, United States Code §544. Two separate meetings were held:
Wilmington, DE, November 1-17, 2000, at the VA Medical and Regional Office
Center, and Washington, DC, April 2-4, 2001, at VA Central Office. The
Committee reviewed several program areas during its meetings and received
briefings and reports from VA officials and others on a variety of issues including:

Veterans’ Business Development

VA’s Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)

Program

VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program

VA’s Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization Program

VA Hepatitis C Centers

Race-Related Experience Scale for Asian American Veterans with PTSD

Community Based Veterans Organizations — The Veterans Benefits

Clearinghouse

Racial Differences in Mortality Rates — Disparity in Health Care —

JAMA Report

Veterans Demographic Data — VetPop2000

Department of the Army In-Service Higher Education Programs

The Committee also reviewed the status of recommendations from
previous reports and expressed concerns that several recommendations have
not been fully implemented.

The Advisory Committee focused its November 2000 meeting on veterans’
business development. As a result of the enactment of Public Law 106-50, the
Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 2000, the
Committee requested briefings from the VA Director, Office of Small and
Disadvantaged Business Utilization, and aé report from the Associate
Administrator for Veterans Business Development at the Small Business
Administration. The Committee also received information concerning the
legislative history of the Veterans’ Business Development Act.

Additionally, the newly appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diversity
Management and Equal Employment Opportunity spoke to us and shared his
plan for improving VA diversity and reducing the incidence of EEO complaints.

The Committee took advantage of the proximity to the Philadelphia
Regional Office and Insurance Center and was able to tour both facilities and
receive informative briefings from the Center Director and key staff members.

193,"We also had an opportunity to meet with Dr. Chalsa Loo, a VA PTSD
Center Honolulu researcher, who shared the results of a study she conducted on
the “Race Related Experience Scale for Asian American Veterans with PTSD.”

The April 2001 meeting, held in Washington, DC, was an occasion to meet
Secretary Principi and follow-up on issues raised in previous meetings. As a
result, we briefly discussed the results of the program evaluation for the
Montgomery GI Bill education programs and obtained additional information
concerning Hepatitis C treatment.

Dr. Ashish K. Jha, a VA researcher at the San Francisco VAMC provided
a report on a published study in the Journal of the American Medical Association
(JAMA) concerning Racial Differences in Mortality Rates — Disparity in Health
Care.

The Director of VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service
briefed the Committee. We also received information on the new veterans
population survey tool from the VA actuary staff.

The Committee viewed a moving video produced by the VA Tucson
Medical Center entitled “Serving Native American Veterans — RESPECT” that
focused on feed back from Native American veterans and their perception of VA
care.

We concluded with a presentation from the Adjutant General of the Army
who familiarized us with the Army’s college degree programs and the Army
University Access on Line Program.

Report on the Wilmington, DE, Meeting
General:

The Advisory Committee conducted its field hearing at the VA Medical and
Regional Office Center (VAMROC) in Wilmington, DE. Mr. Antonio Davila,
Director, Delaware Commission of Veterans Affairs, was the host, along with the
Director and staff of the VAMROC. The primary focus of this meeting was
business development and contracting opportunities within government for
veteran-owned small businesses. Additional discussions with Mr. Armando
Rodriguez, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diversity Management and EEO,
concentrated on VA diversity management and equal employment opportunity
programs. Dr. Chalsa Loo, VA PTSD Center Honolulu reported on the results of
her research study that examined the relationship of racism and PTSD in Asian
American veterans.

A
",0,0,0,0
194,"Veterans Entrepreneurship:

Veteran-owned business opportunities have been an area of concern to
this Committee for quite some time. Mr. Scott Denniston, Director, VA Office of
Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, appeared before the Committee
to update us on VA’s progress to meet its minority and veteran-owned
contracting goals. He presented a good news/bad news scenario. There are
more small businesses being created, but more business opportunities are
needed. These businesses have more than 60 percent of their contracts outside
of government. He reported that the number of contracting opportunities has
been cut in half because of the use of the government purchase card for
procurements under $25,000, and secondly, the numbers of smaller contracts
have been reduced. Other factors contributing to the reduced use of minority-
and veteran-owned businesses include the following items: (1) a reliance on
prime vendors to cover the entire country; (2) a lack of confidence in minority—
owned businesses by government contracting officials; (3) a lack of importance
from senior managers on the need for effective outreach and lastly; (4) a lack of
contracting plans to identify and locate minority and veteran-owned businesses.

VA’s Small Business Program is a decentralized system with a small
Central Office staff operating with fewer resources to monitor small business
contracting by VA field facilities. This may be causing percentages of goal
accomplishments to decline. Field contracting officers report to facility Directors,
not the OSDBU Director.

There are several changes that must occur in order to revolutionize the VA
corporate culture concerning veteran-owned and _ minority-owned = small
businesses. Myths, misunderstandings, and stereotypes in relation to veteran
and minority-owned businesses must be defeated in order to see positive results.
We highly recommend the following actions: (1) VA should improve
documentation for its outreach efforts to veteran- and minority-owned small
businesses; (2) we encourage the Secretary to set higher contracting goals for
these businesses and establish incentives for contracting officers to increase the
number of minority- and veteran-owned companies doing business with VA; and
(3) Contracting officers should have a clause relating to minority- and veteran-
owned business contracting in their performance plan. Furthermore, we
recommend that a program evaluation of the VA small business program be
conducted to determine the effectiveness of the program and to identify program
weaknesses.

",0,0,0,0
195,"Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development
Act:

On August 17, 1999, Public Law 106-50, the Veterans’ Entrepreneurship
and Small Business Development Act of 1999, was enacted. The Committee
requested to be briefed on the impact that this law will have on minority veterans.

Mr. William D. Elmore, Associate Administrator, Office of Veterans’
Business Development, Small Business Administration (SBA); Mr. Rick
Weidman, Vietnam Veteran of America (VVA); and Mr. Alan Gibson, VVA
Missouri State Council, gave an extensive briefing on a number of key issues.
They made several suggestions to the Committee to reduce the barriers for
disabled veterans as well as recommendations that would enhance their
marketability with businesses: (1) Increase outreach programs so that veterans
are aware of available programs; (2) Provide training to develop practical
business and marketing skills; (3) Provide motivational training and counseling to
assist disabled veterans interested in entrepreneurship; and (4) Educate the
general population to purge the stereotypical connotations associated with the
word “disabled”.

Mr. Elmore created the position of an Associate Administrator for
Veterans’ Business Development at the SBA. This position eliminates layers that
prevent information or concerns from being transmitted through the appropriate
channels. According to Mr. Elmore, mentoring and access to capital is key to the
success for entrepreneurial veterans.

Workforce Diversity Plan:

Mr. Armando Rodriguez, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Diversity
Management and EEO, spoke with the Committee at length concerning diversity
goals for the Federal Government and VA and emphasized the need to ensure
minority veterans are a part of the solution. VA is expected to have 76,000 new
positions available, and the Department is working on hiring minorities, women,
and people with disabilities. Implementation of the White House Hispanic
Employment Initiative Executive Order will assist in diversifying the Federal
Government. Additionally, most people do no understand that people with
disabilities are also minorities with disabilities, and there is a proposition to have
a numerical goal to hire minorities with disabilities.

Mr. Rodriguez recommended that VA design a solid diversity program,
increase resources and encourage incentives for those persons employed in the
area of workforce wellness and diversity employment. Other recommendations
are (1) Provide training on sensitivity and intercultural communications to
address the differences in cross-cultural communication; (2) Assign minorities to
SES rating panels and provide solid individual development plans; (3) Analyze

6
",0,0,0,0
196,"career development training to determine the racial, ethnic, and gender
perspective and increase minority participation; (4) Develop innovative recruiting,
which can include partnering with other agencies and groups. This also includes
marketing the organization and creating appealing recruitment advertisements.
Asian American Vietnam Veterans Race-Related Study (AVRS):

Chalsa M. Loo, PhD, is the Principal Investigator, National Center for
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Pacific Islands Division, Spark M.
Mastunaga VA Medical & Regional Office Center, Honolulu, Hawaii. Dr. Loo
briefed the Committee on the major objectives of the AVRS study. The primary
emphasis of this study was to construct a validated scale to measure the
exposure to race-related stresses in the military on Asian American veterans with
PTSD, and secondly, to know what contributions race-related stresses have on
PTSD and other psychiatric disorders. This 3-year study used both surveys and
focus groups to sample 300 Asian American Vietnam veterans. The theory
model race-related stresses were composed of three factors: (1) direct
experience on race, prejudice, and stigmatism, (2) bicultural identification, and
(3) exposure to racist environments. One finding indicated that Asian American
soldiers related to the Vietnamese people and this caused stress, which was
further exacerbated when these soldiers were accused of being Vietnamese that
killed American soldiers.

Following the discussions, the Committee recommended that the study be
presented to VA officials and eventually to the general public. Additionally, it is
critical to develop comprehensive treatment for minority veterans affected by
PTSD due to racism, to include all Asian veterans. It would be beneficial if this
study could be repeated with Native Americans and expanded to other minority
groups.

Report on the Washington, DC, Meeting
General:

The Advisory Committee meeting was held at VA Central Office to give the
members an opportunity to introduce themselves to Secretary Principi and
communicate their goals and objectives. This meeting allowed both the Secretary
and the Committee to address important issues and discuss areas that impact all
veterans. The Committee also heard reports from several key individuals. They
were Mr. Ralph Cooper, Executive Director, Veterans Benefits Clearinghouse;
Mr. Julius Williams, Director Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service;
and Dr. Ashish K. Jha, who spoke on Racial Differences in Mortality Among Men
Hospitalized in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System. Additional

7
",0,0,0,0
197,"presentations were made by Ms. Janet Thompson, VHA Office of Civil Rights; Dr.
Michael Cantor of the VHA National Center for Ethics; and Dr. Lawrence Deyton,
Chief Consultant to Public Health Strategic Healthcare Group (PHSHG). The
Director, Center for Minority Veterans, Mr. Willie Hensley, also gave an overview
of his programs’ initiatives and objectives.

Secretary Principi’s Comments:

The Secretary addressed the Committee commenting that he will look to
the Committee for advice and guidance. Minority veterans make up 25 percent
of the overall veteran populations and both VA and the Committee have a
responsibility to ensure they have access to programs and benefits, the
Secretary stated. The Secretary relayed several concerns. He stressed the fact
that minority veterans do not utilize education benefits—only 50 percent take
advantage of this program. Also it is important, he stated, to ensure the VA
workforce is diversified, for example only 2 medical center Directors—out of
172—are Hispanic. The Secretary has established four priorities: (1) to provide
veterans with timely and accurate decisions of disability claims; (2) to increase
veterans access to high quality health care, including specialized services, (3) to
maintain our cemeteries as national shrines; and (4) to ensure that information
technology serves to break down the barriers within our Department and
eliminate the barriers separating us from other Departments.

Veterans Benefit Clearinghouse (VBC):

Mr. Ralph Cooper briefed the Committee on the Veterans Benefit
Clearinghouse (VBC), whose focus is directed toward improving the quality of life
of veterans and their families living in the West Roxbury section of Boston, MA.
The VBC serves 4,000 veterans and their families. Supporters of this program
include Massachusetts Department of Veteran Services, U.S. Department of
Labor, City of Boston, Neighborhood Jobs Trust, numerous foundations,
corporations, and a variety of state agencies. This program conducts an annual
stand-down for homeless veterans; provides information on HIV prevention and
education; employment and training; drug rehabilitation assistance; and support
for family members. Currently VBC is concentrating on fund raising efforts to
meet budget demands and establishing partnerships with ministers to support
initiatives for faith-based program assistance.

Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment Service:

Mr. Julius Williams, Director Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment
Service, discussed the role and mission of this job training and employment
program for veterans. The purpose of this program is to provide service and

8
",0,0,0,0
198,"assistance to veterans who have a minimum of 20 percent service-connected
disability. This service assists these veterans to achieve maximum independence
in daily living and when possible become employable and maintain suitable
employment.

Statistically those who complete the program are 41 years old, with 87
percent over age 30, and 69 percent with 1 or more dependents. The average
income for this group entering the program is $4,942 and the average income for
those completing the program is $28,671. The rehabilitation rate was 64.5
percent at end of FY 2000 and 62 percent for those with serious employment
handicaps. Average stay in the program is 31 months. Once employed the
individual must remain at the place of employment for a minimum of 60 days.
Participants in the program are typically 39 years old; are high school graduates
and 78 percent having 1 or more dependents.

Some initiatives underway are to increase out-based service locations,
improve communications, expand case management, and implement an
employment specialist pilot project. Additional strategies included refinement of
employment services and strengthening partnerships.

The Committee expressed concerns that disabled veterans are at a
disadvantage when diagnosed while on active duty, and should be registered as
a disabled veteran and eligible for vocational rehabilitation prior to separating
from active duty. The Committee is also concerned that the Service does not
maintain any demographic data by race or ethnicity.

Racial Differences in Mortality:

Dr. Ashish K. Jha reported that Black patients who are treated in non-VA
hospitals receive fewer tests and less therapy after admission for heart attack
and lung cancer. They have worse outcomes after kidney transplants, cancers,
and readmission after heart attack. These problems are caused by insufficient or
inadequate insurance, lack of access to good medical facilities, regular primary
care physicians, and minimal medical attention for chronic conditions. He
reported that Black veterans admitted to VA medical facilities fared much better.
Although Dr. Jha presented statistical data, the Committee did not feel that the
data was representative of the population. Also the Committee recommended
that Dr. Jha expand the study to include other minorities and survey more
facilities. An additional recommendation included that the Committee receive a
briefing from the Houston VA Research Center to learn more about the database
being utilized.

9
",0,0,0,0
199,"Serving Native American Veterans:

Ms. Janet Thompson is the Co-Chair of the Native American Advisory
Council and represents the VHA Office of Civil Rights. Ms. Thompson called for
new approaches and a new vision to serve the Native American veteran. She
emphasized that we must acknowledge their spiritual beliefs, cultural, and
historical mores. Currently there are 190,000 Native American veterans and 558
tribes. Approximately 42,000 served in Vietnam, and 90 percent of those
veterans were volunteers. Among these veterans there are recipients of 2
Congressional Medals of Honor, 71 Air Medals, 51 Silver Stars, and 47 Bronze
Stars.

The problems we face now are that many of these veterans do not speak
English well. Therefore, they do not understand the procedures and have
difficulty obtaining transportation to health care facilities. Oftentimes they live in
remote areas, with only 1 phone for 300 people. Also it is important to
understand that Native Americans think in their native language and must
mentally translate their answer into English before responding. As a result, these
Individuals will nod “yes” even when they do not comprehend the question.

Additionally, understanding the Native American cultural belief system is
imperative to addressing care and benefits. The Committee recommended the
following suggestions: (1) utilize the video “Serving Native American Veterans—
RESPECT—A better way to serve the Native American” as a training tool at VA
hospitals and nursing schools; (2) provide funding to expand the video to include
other Native Americans and make this available for viewing by all VA employees;
(3) Form a partnership between the Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans
and the Native American Advisory Council to support their efforts to sensitive
health care givers; and (4) obtain the Secretary’s support.

Hepatitis C Treatment:

Dr. Lawrence Deyton, Chief Consultant to Public Health Strategic
Healthcare Group (PHSHG), Victoria Darcey, Deputy Chief Consultant, Public
Health and Environmental Hazards, and Dr. Abid Raham, Government Liaison,
PHSHG, participated in these discussions. Dr. Deyton reported that African
Americans had the highest incidence rates of Hepatitis C (HCV) infection.
Statistically the sources of infection for persons with HCV are drug use (60%),
sexual (15%), transfusions before screening (10%), other (5%), unknown (0%),
and health care workers (2%). Over 70,000 veterans have been diagnosed with
HCV, and most disquieting is that VA studies continuously leave out major
minority groups.

Of major concern is that too few Native Americans use the health care
system and consequently are under represented in the study. This also means

10
",0,0,0,0
200,"they are not being tested nor treated. Dr. Deyton noted that VHA has placed
increased emphasis on screening and testing of veterans for HCV and
recommended that a plan and strategy be developed for outreach assistance to
all veterans, including the three most affected groups—African Americans,
Hispanics, and Native Americans. Outreach efforts to date have not been
focused, and a community advisory group is being formed to develop a strategy
and further recommendations.

Center for Minority Veterans:

Mr. Willie Hensley, CMV Director, informed the Committee on the
following major initiatives: (1) Medical research into prostate cancer, (2) cultural
factors in cardiac adaptation to chronic illness; and (3) delivery of health care to
Native Americans and Hispanics. Mr. Hensley indicated that the Minority
Veterans Program Coordinator phone conference averages 70 participants each
month, however, the goal is 100 participants. The bi-monthly veteran’s phone
conference averages 15 participants a session. The goal is 30 participants a
session.

201,"Committee Recommendations

The Committee recommends that VA:
Number 1. Revitalize the Small and Disadvantaged Business program to
improve veterans’ participation in business opportunities with VA.
Number 2. Conduct a Small/Minority Business Conference and include VA
senior management, contracting officers, and small business owners. Request
the Secretary make this a matter of his interest and include it in evaluations.
Number 3. Develop and implement a workforce diversity program with
incentives to ensure the desired results for a comprehensive diversity plan.
This is particularly important in addressing future workforce deficiencies. There
are 35,827 full-time permanent VA employees who are 55 years or older. There
are a total of 40,372 full-time/part-time/temporary VA employees who are 55
years of age and over. This total includes the 35,827 full-time permanent
employees cited above. A diversity plan could be implemented without difficulty.
Number 4. Reemphasize the need for sensitivity training throughout VA,
specifically in the health care system.
Number 5. Establish partnerships with colleges and universities and utilize
these institutions as a resource to recruit and educate persons on careers with
VA.

The Honorable Anthony J. Principi

Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs

810 Vermont Avenue, N.W.

Washington, D.C. 20420

Dear Secretary Principi:

We have completed our assigned responsibilities and we are pleased to submit the Eighth Annual

Report of the Department of Veterans Affairs Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans.

We are extremely grateful to you and Deputy Secretary Leo S. MacKay, Jr. for meeting with us

and offering your guidance, encouragement and support. The leadership and direction taken by

Center for Minority Veterans Director Charles Nesby has been paramount to the success of the

Center for Minority Veterans. Mr. Nesby and his office staff have worked cooperatively with the

Committee; their professionalism is worthy of high praise. All members of the Advisory Committee

are to be commended for their diligent work and serious commitment to improving services to our

minority veterans’ community

The site visit to Chicago helped the Advisory Committee gain further insight into the issues

impacting our minority veterans and that need further examination and careful consideration.

Based on the site visit, the previous annual reports, and the work done this year by the Advisory

Committee, our 2002 report has identified the following issues as the most significant and

prevalent to the minority veterans’ community.

1. Recommend doubling the number of outreach personnel for the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National
Cemetery Administration (NCA) in FY04 with an end goal of tripling the number of
outreach personnel in the FY 06 budget.

2. Recommend the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) develop a process for ensuring
access to business contracts with VA by veteran owned businesses with an end goal of
increasing contract awards to veteran owned, small businesses to 10% of all awarded
contracts by FY04.

3. Recommend VHA integrate health services accessibility with the Indian Health Service
including increased usage of contract medicine or CHAMPYVA in rural areas.

These issues are relevant and deserve your utmost attention. We are optimistic that your

excellent leadership and your seriousness about our veterans’ community will result in having our

recommendations successfully implemented. Thank you for your service to America and our
veterans’ community.

Sincerely,

Francisco F. Ivarra

Chair, VA Advisory Committee

214,"General Overview

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) convened three times
during the 2002 Fiscal Year. The first committee meeting for the fiscal year
convened in Chicago, Illinois November 5 through November 8, 2001; the
second meeting occurred in Washington, D.C. March 25 through 27, 2002. The
ACMV met again, June 10 through June 12, 2002 in Washington, D.C. for the
sole purpose of preparing the Eighth Annual Report of the Advisory Committee
on Minority Veterans.

The Advisory Committee underwent major personnel changes. Eight new
members, constituting nearly half the committee, were appointed: Joey
Strickland, Carson Ross, Clifford McDowell, John Jefferson, Jerry Cochran, Sr.,
Bob Archuleta, Renaee Allen, and Al Zapanta. Francisco lvarra was elected the
new chairman and Don Loudner was elected vice chair.

Departing committee members included the Chairman, General George Price, as
well as Talmadge Foster, Gumersindo Gomez, Fred Gorden, Otho Lister, Gary
Metoxen, Dr. Roselyn Rice and Sharon Richie.

Outgoing Chairman, General Price recommended several topics of emphasis for
the committee to consider including:

e Continued improvement of outreach to minority veterans;

e Special emphasis on improving services to the most
disenfranchised veterans i.e. low-income, homeless and severely
disabled veterans;

e Veterans that are isolated or living in rural areas require continued
emphasis for delivering critical services;

e Adopt the premises that inspect, detect, correct, challenge and
respond are the best methods for improving services;

e Strongly recommended making the committee permanent;

e Prejudice and bias are alive and well so the committee and the VA
must continue to combat these challenges whenever they are
encountered in the services network;

e Native American issues remain a major challenge, specifically with
regard to:

o BIA

o Housing

o Health Issues
General Price challenged the committee to remain as the review board for
studies ensuring minority populations were included. He encouraged the
committee to continually challenge data presented by VA by cross checking
demographic information with DoD databases, especially since VA databases
rarely contain minority information.

215,"Report on the Meeting at Chicago, Illinois
The Advisory Committee met in Chicago, Illinois November 5 through November
8, 2001. This was the only site visit made by the ACMV in FY2002. Budget
constraints precluded more site visits and consequently have prevented the
ACMV from fully executing its statutory requirements.
MVPCs
While in Chicago, the ACMV met with the Minority Veteran Program
Coordinator’s (MVPCs) from the immediate area as well as one Women Veteran
Program Coordinator. The facilities represented were:

e VA Regional Office, Chicago

e VA Medical Center, North Chicago

e VA Medical Center, Westside
Topics and details of issues discussed with the MVPCs include:
e Outreach activities
Several MVPCs indicated that the major challenges they encountered included
severe constrains on the time allotted to executing MVPC duties; lack of funding
for outreach activities; lack of support or interest by directors for the MVPC
program or the conduct of outreach activities; and difficulty accessing
communities where minority veteran populations reside. At least one MVPC
cited that gaining access to the Hispanic Community in the Chicago Area was
especially difficult. They also had difficulty identifying Native American veterans
in the area. One MVPC noted that outreach activities were being curtailed
because the facility did not have enough funding to handle the patient load they
were currently serving.
e Facility Director Support
There did not appear to be uniformity among the MVPCs with regard to support
from their individual Directors. Some cited excellent support while at least one
indicated the Director interfered with the execution of their MVPC duties by
limiting outreach activities due to overflow of patients already receiving care from
the facility.
e Development of Community Minority Veterans Committee
Only one facility acknowledged having a Minority Veteran Committee; other
facilities cited inadequate time and staff as barriers to establishing one, but
believed there would be value in establishing a special committee to address
Minority Veterans and the delivery of care and services. The lack of funding, lack
of interdepartmental coordination, and overworked personnel continue to plague
the MVPC program. This in turn affects outreach to minority veterans.

5
",0,0,0,0
216,"e Time spent on MVPC duties
The time spent on Outreach varied between the different MVPCs. Some
believed 20% of their time was spent on MVPC duties while others felt that their
positions intertwined directly with their MVPC duties making the separation of
time allotted difficult to discern. The main issue is no specific guidance and
funding have been identified addressing the amount of time MVPCs should be
allocated to execute their duties. It is on a case-by-case basis and often
determined by the immediate supervisor or the director of the facility. Viewed as
a collateral duty, MVPCs have difficulty executing robust outreach activities due
to time constraints imposed by their primary duties. This substantially erodes the
effectiveness of the program and creates conflict within the organization as it
struggles to meet all requirements imposed by special programs on top of
primary mission tasking. Obligating specific funding for the program would be
best achieved by identifying specific FTE for the program vice the current ad hoc
method of simply assigning the responsibility as a collateral duty with no specific
funding. This will have the dual effect of lending uniformity and “teeth” to the
MVPC program.
e Minority Veteran Population Statistics
This issue remains the single biggest challenge for MVPCs and the Department.
The policy for gathering race/ethnic/gender statistics by the Department is not
uniform and often allows facility directors the leeway to prevent the gathering of
demographics on veterans receiving their services. Consequently, VA data on
the makeup of their veteran population is incomplete and often erroneous.
Reliance on the Census data is flawed because questions regarding military
status are unclearly defined and many respondents do not identify themselves as
veterans. The time that elapses between complete Census polls also may serve
to under represent the true minority veteran population due to the rapidly
changing demographics of the country and those with military service. Without
statistics on the minority veteran population it is difficult to analyze the quality of
service received and whether the correct services are being offered to minority
veteran populations. This is a major concern of MVPCs, the Advisory Committee
on Minority Veterans and the Center for Minority Veterans.
VISN 12 Director
The ACMV met with Dr. Joan Cummings, Director of the Great Lakes Health
Care System (VISN 12). The ensuing discussion identified the following issues:
e The difficulty of interceding on behalf of minority veterans in the inner city
areas of Milwaukee and Chicago.
e The need to use mobile clinics to increase care to veterans in Milwaukee.
e VISN 12 is considering increasing the number of Community Based Outreach
Clinics (CBOCs) in the Chicago and Milwaukee areas.
6
",0,0,0,0
217,"e Substance abuse outreach is under resourced. Need more funding and
personnel to ensure VISN 12 is reaching out to the minority veteran
population.

e One of the more problematic constraints facing VISN 12 is the difficulty the
VISN has partnering with State and local government.

e Federal restrictions requiring VA have Cooke County bid for contract services
precludes the VISN from developing favored partner status with local
business and getting best value. This requires Congressional legislation.

e The delaying of services to Priority 7 veterans is being used to help address
the $50 million budget shortfall VISN 12 is currently experiencing. The
director is also looking to save money by consolidating redundant clinical
programs. The budget shortfall is also impacting outreach efforts to minority
veteran populations.

Positive activities were also discussed including:

e VISN 12 now provides maternity care for eligible veterans.

e Partnerships similar to Medical School affiliations with state and local
governments have been established.

e VISN 12 received two of the four VA-wide awards from Office of Small and
Disadvantaged Business (OSDBU):

o Hub Zone award
o Greatest number of minority owned business contracts

Medical Center Directors

The ACMV met with directors from the VISN 12 medical facilities. Following are

synopsis of topics and issues discussed by facility.

Al Pate, Director North Chicago VAMC

Major challenges have been:

e The reduction of 800 FTE over past the five years.

e Major portions of their clientele are minorities. Specifically, he estimates
that 40% of inpatients and 17% of outpatients are minorities.

e Although the facility has developed community partners in business, has
to acknowledge that doing business with the Federal Government is very
perplexing and difficult for partners. Recommended the Department hold
seminars on how to contract and conduct business with VA and federal
government.

e The facility requires more resources so can provide more services to
underserved veterans.

Major gains include:

e Since 1996, VARO North Chicago and the U.S. Navy have a joint location
for processing Compensation and Pension exams and claims.

7
",0,0,0,0
218,"e They are currently considering an agreement where Illinois Department of
Veterans Affairs will lease space from North Chicago VMAC to build a
State Veterans Home on the grounds of the VMAC.

Mr. Richard Citron, Director Great Lakes Health Care System (HCS)

VA Great Lakes HCS came into existence in 1996 when Lakeside and Westside
Medical Centers combined. Lakeside Medical Center is located on the Gold
Coast adjacent to Lake Michigan and is affiliated with the Northwestern
University Medical School. Westside Medical Center is located on the west side
of Chicago and is affiliated with the University of Illinois Medical School. The
demographic of the patients visiting the two facilities is identified as 65% African
American, 10% Hispanic/ other, and 20% White.

Challenges include:

e Impact of CARES plan on Northwestern University Medical School
affiliation, there is a substantive number of veterans who are opposed to
the closing of any inpatient programs in VA.

e VA Chicago HCS serves a large percentage of minority and under served
populations, but it does not have enough resources to conduct viable
outreach to minority areas. Especially required are CBOCs in the city of
Chicago. Current outreach consists of health screenings at health fair
stand-downs.

Positives include:

e VA North Chicago has implemented hospital based home care where VA

staff goes to the veteran’s home to provide care and services.
Dennis Lewis, Director Hines VAMC
Hines VAMC serves the collar counties that surround Chicago and Cooke
County. Currently the Medical Center has a low penetration rate into the minority
veteran population but is seeing a steady rise in minority veterans serviced.
Hines VAMC currently operates seven CBOCs.
Challenges include:

e Currently experiencing difficulty attracting Hispanic veterans. Plans are
being considered to moving the CBOC from Oak Park to Austin area in an
effort to attract more Hispanic and other minority veterans.

Positives include:

e There is deep concern that there ts little succession planning in place at
Hines VAMC. The Director has initiated a program for mentoring, staff
development and employee-training programs.

8
",0,0,0,0
219,"e To revitalize staff performance, the Director reinstated the incentive
awards program; $340,000 in awards had been given out as of November
2001.

Chicago Regional Office

The ACMV took a tour of the Chicago Regional Office. The backlog of benefits
claims remains a major obstacle. The Regional Office had a reported backlog of
40,000 cases with an average adjudication time of over two hundred days. It
was mentioned that is was much easier to deny benefits than to grant the benefit
because of stringent requirements of VBA and Court of Appeal for Veterans
Claims. However, the Director stated that he counsels his staff to find ways to
grant benefits rather than deny benefits.

Veteran Community Meeting

The ACMV held a community meeting providing an opportunity to air concerns to
the committee. The meeting was open to veterans, veteran service
organizations and any entities offering services to veterans. The following
encapsulates topics and concerns discussed:

e Veterans are not happy about the proposed increase in co-pay for
prescriptions. There is a concern that the most disenfranchised will bear
a heavier burden if the co-pay is increased.

e There is concern that the decision to close two mental health inpatient
programs at Hines VAMC is flawed.

e General consensus that all Chicago Land hospitals should remain open;
there is grave concern about the level of care available to minority
veterans when CARES is enacted in the VISN 12 service area.

The findings from the Chicago area visit by ACMV are incorporated into the
committee’s recommendations to the Secretary.

The ACMV met March 25 through March 27, 2002 in Washington D.C. The
focus of the meeting was educating the eight new committee members on the
major issues facing minority veterans. The two and one half days consisted
entirely of briefings, which are summarized below.
Ron Henke, Director Compensation and Pension Service, Veteran Benefits
Administration discussed claims processing reforms. Mr. Henke referred to the
push currently in place for a “virtual VA,” replacing paper with electronic means
for handling the every day business in the Department. He mentioned that the
effort to reduce the claims backlog has resulted in new hires, developing Tiger
Teams to handle priority claims processing, and ensuring the presence of
Spanish-speaking individuals in main processing centers to help Spanish
speaking veterans with claims. The Department is also working with Veterans
Service Organizations to assist in processing disability claims. Two outstanding
issues that remain are the difficulty in utilizing remote access to veterans’
records, which can hamper the processing of claims, and the relatively low
number of veterans hired into claims processing. It is believed that hiring
veterans to work with other veterans in processing their claims would improve
customer service and expedite the entire process.
James Amos, Jr., CEO Mailboxes, etc. spoke about franchising opportunities for
minority owned businesses. He shared information about the International
Franchise Association that could offer veterans information about franchises and
owning a business. He was concerned that approximately 70% of education
funding for veterans was left untouched and implored the Department to increase
outreach and information to veterans about the different education and
employment benefits available.
Wayne Simpson, Deputy Director, Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization (OSDBU) discussed latest ventures. The Center for Veteran's
Enterprise (CVE) offers a program that concentrates on programs assisting
veterans interested in owning their own businesses. A major initiative is the
development of a database of veteran-owned small businesses that will be made
available to government and major contractors. He is aware how difficult it is for
veteran-owned small businesses to break into VA. The Department has only met
.22% of its 3% goal for service disabled veteran contracts. Mr. Simpson said
this goal is an inaccurate measure of the real issue, which is the hiring of veteran
owned businesses vice only tracking disabled veteran contracts. He
recommended the Committee on Minority Veterans get a briefing from the VA
Procurement Executive concerning the issue. This has been added to the
agenda for the next committee session.
Col. Charles Washington, Washington-Harris Group, Inc. expounded on the
difficulties veteran-owned businesses, especially minority owned businesses,

10
",0,0,0,0

contract unless one has a close relationship with a contract logistic officer, which
is very difficult to achieve.
Major General Charles Henry (ret), [he Veterans Corporation described the
organization’s mission. Public Law 106-50 enacted the Corporation. Its mission
is to increase business opportunities for Veterans, create certification standards
for veteran-owned small businesses, and develop information centers about
business opportunities. The Corporation must raise matching funds to equal
initial government funding and eventually privatize.
Dr. Alfonso Batres, Director Readjustment Counseling Service presented a video
on Tele-Medicine; a computer assisted counseling service provided for veterans
at Vet Centers. The program has been extremely successful, and the VA is
currently expanding it to those Vet Centers that will benefit from the extended
services delivery that Tele-Medicine provides to include deployment of the
system to Native American reservations.
Dr. Irene Trowell-Harris, Director, Center for Women Veterans outlined the major
issues the Center for Women Veterans is currently addressing to include:
healthcare, housing, financial planning, employment and education for women
veterans.
The four subcommittees, using the aforementioned briefings and visit to Chicago,

individuals and presenters as well as reflect observations made during site visits.

Employment, Training & Business Opportunities (ETBO) Subcommittee
Report

Statement of the Chairperson — We strongly encourage closure and support of
prior recommendations in past annual reports that remain open. The Department
of Veterans Affairs must provide an opportunity for minority veterans and their
families to participate in employment, training, and business opportunities to help
minority veterans fulfill and maintain a successful standard of living.

David O. Chung, Chair

Carson Ross, Vice-Chair

Terry R. Holden

John Jefferson

Kim M. Pignatiello

The following recommendations from prior reports by the Center for Minority
Veterans remain open:

e Third Annual Report — No 34--Review the SBA veteran loan program and
identify obstacles experienced by veterans trying to start businesses.

e Sixth Annual Report — No 5--Review VA strategies for increasing business
with minority and women-owned businesses in an effort to ensure that the
agency's business performance goals are met. Further, accountability and
responsibility should be established to ensure that contracting goals for
minority, disabled, and women-owned small businesses are met in VA
Headquarters and field facilities.

e Seventh Annual Report —

No 1--Revitalize the Small and Disadvantaged Business program to
Improve veterans’ participation in business opportunities with VA.
No 2--Conduct a Small/Minority Business Conference and include VA
senior management, contracting officers, and small business owners.
Request the Secretary make this a matter of his interest and include it
In evaluations.
No 3--Develop and implement a workforce diversity program with
incentives to ensure the desired results for a comprehensive diversity
plan.
No 5--Establish partnerships with colleges and universities and utilize
these institutions as a resource to recruit and educate persons on
careers with VA.
The prior recommendations remain open and this subcommittee would like to
know the status of these points in an attempt to establish closure.
Recommendations — In addition to the above recommendations, the ETBO
Subcommittee also recommends the following:
14
",0,0,0,0
225,"1. Recommend the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans become a
permanent Advisory Committee to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
Permanent status will ensure effective identification and recommendations
of ongoing issues related to minority veterans and allow continuity in the
monitoring of the results of those recommendations.

2. Recommend increased funding of this committee to enable
subcommittees to travel and accept testimony from end users as well as
service providers. (Per the chartered mission requirements) This budget
should facilitate a minimum of three site visits per year and allow us to
report findings to the committee as a whole at our annual visits.

3. Recommend the VA Human Resources department re-evaluate full time
employee manpower demographics throughout the VA system to better
track the hiring and placement of qualified minority veterans through
targeted recruitment.

4. Recommend VA collect data pertaining to small business loan applications
in order to compare different minorities that apply.

5. Recommend SBA Loan Coordinators be staffed at VA offices making it
more accessible to the minority veteran. The VA must give us data on
policies pertaining to the qualifying factors for vocational rehabilitation and
evaluate the process to help standardize this procedure.

6. Recommend the VA acquire data on companies that are under
government contract to determine if they are hiring minority veteran-
owned businesses. Priority should be given to minority veteran-owned
businesses when contracting for specialized services.

7. Itis apparent that a large percentage of minority veterans are not informed
nor have participated in programs offered by the offices of Small and
Disadvantaged Business Utilization as stated in their report for June 7,
2000. The small business chart in the report shows significant erosion
(women-owned businesses) from FY98 through FY2000. Of particular
interest are Public Law 106-50 and SBA Law 105-135, which clearly
establish Veterans Outreach Programs for business centers to counsel
veterans in preparing for business. We recommend the VA utilize these
laws and develop a tracking system to monitor effectiveness. The
minority vet does not have access to procurement system. The
system is available to disabled vets, not minority vets.

8. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act, passed in August 1999, and the
Interim Rule on Contract Bundling have not been widely publicized in
areas where ethnic and minority veterans live. What needs to be
determined is how businesses and corporations that have government

15
",0,0,0,0
226,"contracts interact with these programs and if they are following guidelines
when subcontracting veteran owned businesses or hiring veterans that fall
within policy set forth by law
9. Recommend the VA evaluate the new programs in No 7 & 8 and report
any findings that can be used to improve how the SBA administers to
minority veterans.

Clifford Mcdowell, Member

This report is based on subcommittee members’ knowledge of veteran’s issues

and interviews with veterans.

It is public knowledge that with a budget exceeding $51 billion and over 200,000

VA employees serving our nation’s veterans in hundreds of VA Medical Centers

and clinics, we still have unresolved issues and concerns pertaining to the

treatment and acknowledgement of minority veterans.

Minority veterans have served honorably in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines,

and Coast Guard and comprised approximately 25% of the veteran population.

We, who serve and represent our veterans, must accept the responsibility to

ensure that access to programs, benefits, and healthcare by minority veterans

reaches an equality level never obtained in our country’s history.

The following findings of the Subcommittee on Healthcare are concerns that

affect minority veterans on a daily basis.

1. Recommend VA employees receive sensitivity training on processing minority
veterans for initial appointments. Training should cover how to meet, greet,
and inform each veteran of the enrollment process, treatment, and services.
Further training will aid VA employees in recognizing cultural/ethnic/health
differences within the minority veterans’ community. This will enhance
minority veterans acceptance of the VA system and enhance desire to return
for medical care and follow-up services. Sensitivity training will enable VA
employees to deliver proper and professional assistance to minority veterans.

2. Recommend VA implement a fast track enrollment system for initial
medical appointments with specialists who have training in documentation
required by VA to aide veterans in proper enrollment, thus expediting receipt
of medical care. In some areas of the country, Spanish speaking specialists,
Native Americans and other minority representatives may be required. This
will improve and enhance services and reduce enrollment waiting lists for
medical treatment of veterans, in particular minority veterans. Improper billing
of veterans will be reduced, collection of co-payments will be more effective,
and third-party payments will be received in a timelier manner.

3. Recommend VA develop a more culturally diverse employment practice
within the VA Medical system. Each VA Medical Center, its management and

17
",0,0,0,0
228,"administrative executives as well as medical professionals and staff must be
representative of the population of the veterans’ community it serves.

4. Recommend VA establish a Center for Excellence focusing on dust-induced
lung disease to ensure proper medical treatment and diagnosis in reference
to Information Letter (IL 10-99-004). This position requires a trained medical
physician/specialist in the areas of environmental medicine dealing with dust-
induced lung diseases of former Navy and Marine Corps personnel exposed
to deck grinding dust that may lead to sarcoidosis, Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease, interstitial lung disease, fibrotic lung disease, and
problems in the right heart. This will also enhance treatment of veterans
exposed to Agent Orange, Gulf War and Afghanistan environmental hazards.
Statistically, minority veterans served in the low ranking positions of deck
grinders in the Navy during the 1970's — 1990’s that were continuously
exposed to silica titanium and aluminum, which is the component of the non-
skid paint used on the decks of the aircraft carriers. The lack of an
Environmental Medical Service Physician/Specialist may cause further
unrecognized and misdiagnosed dust-induced lung disease.

5. Recommend that dust-induced lung disease be included as of one of the ten
educational modules under the Veterans Health Initiative Program for fiscal
year 2003.

6. Recommend VA Medical Centers ensure adequate transportation be provided
for those minority and/or low-income veterans residing in rural areas.
Sensitivity and flexibility are needed in transporting veterans to and from
rural areas to VA Medical Centers for medical treatment. Low-income minority
veterans have a particular need due to a lack of financial resources, which
would otherwise enable them access to public transportation. Flexibility in
scheduling is an on-going issue when veterans have no transportation
because appointments run past scheduled shuttle departure times. Implement
a Departure Tracking System to expedite transported veterans through their
medical visits

7. Recommend VHA review and update policies that establish Community
Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) and Vet Center locations relative to rural
areas and the needs of veterans living in outlying areas.

8. Recommend psychiatric care be provided at every CBOC to ensure that a full
continuum of services is offered to every veteran, especially in rural areas.

9. As mandated by law, Committee members must make periodic site visits to
VA Medical Centers throughout the United States. The committee must
adhere to PL 103-446 by congressional mandate. Due to budgetary
constraints, no site visits are scheduled during the balance of fiscal year 2002
and the entire fiscal year 2003. An immediate increase or amendment of the

18
",0,0,0,0
229,"current budget is requested. Increasing the budget in fiscal year 2004 will
allow for continued site visits.

Lourdes E. Alvarado-Ramos, Chair

Robert L. Rollins, Vice-Chair

Don Loudner

The Outreach Subcommittee encourages the VA system to not only maintain, but

also increase its outreach efforts. Veterans are one of our most precious

national resources. Veterans should enjoy every possible benefit their service
makes them eligible for. Through outreach, the Department of Veterans Affairs
should do its utmost to ensure that each veteran receives the services and
benefits that will give them and their eligible family members a better quality of
life. The demonstrated needs of veterans will serve to justify the funding
necessary to properly address these needs in the future.

During the March 2001 meeting, the Outreach and Rehabilitation Subcommittee

selected Ms. Lourdes E. Alvarado-Ramos to chair the subcommittee. This

subcommittee has responsibility that spans across all other subcommittee work
with only three working members. The group will request that more members be
added to ensure equitable distribution of duties. This would allow for every area
that relates to minority veterans to be linked directly to the issue of outreach.

During the 2001 visit to Chicago, a community forum took place at the West Side

VA Medical Center. Audience members were outspoken presenting their issues

related to access and concerns about the potential closure of one of the two

Chicago VAMCs. This was a video recorded formal session and was attended

by a large number of senior VA staff. There were few minority veterans in

attendance. For this reason, we recommend that a small contingency of the

Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans return to Chicago. This visit would pay

particular attention to the outcome of the CARES initiative and how it benefited or

affected minority veterans, as well as both VAMC’s employees and beneficiaries.

Recommendations (Original):

1. Recommend the Secretary provide funding for the Center for Minority
Veteran's FY 03 budget for two site visits to minority veterans concentration
areas in addition to at least one scheduled work session in Washington DC.
This would allow the committee to satisfy the requirement established by law.
This funding should double in the ensuing fiscal year and triple in
subsequent budget years where it would stabilize and provide for six
outreach missions and one work session per year.

2. Recommend VA target the recruitment of minorities, particularly those who
are bilingual, to serve in the health professions and provide culture-sensitive
care.

20
",0,0,0,0
231,"3. Recommend VA provide funding for continuing outreach and collaboration
with the US Navy on the issue of dust induced lung disease. This issue
affects thousands of veterans; many are not aware of the recently established
connection between surface deck grinding in ships and the subsequent
potential development of lung diseases.

4. Recommend VA provide funding to resume health fairs and other outreach
programs that have eroded in recent years. Many VISNs have discontinued
this practice citing overwhelming response by veterans made aware of their
benefits and subsequent access backlogs. Veterans should be made aware
of the benefits they are eligible for—even if it means long waits. Ultimately,
funding should be provided to the VHA to ensure they are able to serve the
growing population of eligible veterans trying to access the VA system.
Through an aggressive communication effort, veterans should be made
aware of the VA’s challenges and placed in priority lists. Those who served
deserve no less.

Recommendations (Revised for final report):

1. That the Secretary provide additional funding be made available to increase
the number of committee site visits.

2. That the Undersecretary for Health establish an outreach program to inform
former military personnel who served in aircraft carriers and other naval
vessels of potential health problems related to dust induced lung disease.

3. That the Secretary directs and resources outreach programs in minority
communities by MVPCs concerning enrollment and other VA benefits.

4. Establish a recruitment and hiring goal to increase the numbers of bilingual
minority veterans’ health care providers.

Joey Strickland (Chair)

General (Ret) Irwin Cockett

Antonio Davila

Ralph Cooper

Our subcommittee mission is to evaluate and assess the effectiveness of

Compensation and Benefits programs for Minority Veterans. Ground has already

been broken on much of what was discussed. Areas of concern continue to be:

1. Quality of Training of Rating and Claims Officers in regards to special
needs and concerns of Minority Veterans and the need to hire more minorities
as ratings/claims officers. This would be a step towards raising VA
sensitivities to the needs of minority veterans pursuing disability claims.

2. Outreach to minority veterans. Continue to develop and improve the
delivering of benefits to minority veterans, with a focus toward ensuring that
minorities are aware that they are entitled to file a claim. This can be done in
several ways:

a. Periodic benefits sessions in minority communities.
b. Conduct “Benefits stand downs’ in the inner cities
c. Implement follow-up visits by VA to see if programs are working.

3. Veterans Minority Programs appear strong at VACO level, but begin to break
down at medical center VA level. It appears that is some cases
representation of minority veterans in the local areas is an extra duty, or
secondary job. Too many VISN and Medical Center Directors do not take it
seriously.

4. Apparent automatic disposition of 10% disability rating by DoD to
medically discharged military personnel. At the Transition point, on the
military bases, the military is hurting veterans by rating them at 10% for
disability. This 10% rating in too many cases appears standard and
incongruent with the actual level of disability. (It is too low) Though the
veteran can appeal to VA for a higher rating, the inordinate waiting period for
reevaluation results in a substantial delay in benefits distribution for the
disabled veteran. Services delayed are equivalent to services denied.

a. The bottom line is that a 10% does not even qualify veterans for
rehabilitation.

b. VA should partner with DOD to develop a more accurate disability
determination process at the DoD level, thus obviating the need for
a second evaluation through the VA appeal process. This would help
to alleviate the VA appeal backlog and expedite services to the
veteran.

22
",0,0,0,0
233,"5. VA doctors require more sensitivity training specifically related to culture care
diversity. (The diagnosis and treatment of diverse patient populations
incorporating their ethno-cultural beliefs and lifestyles.) This is critical to
ensure a fair standard of ratings between Caucasian veterans and minority
veterans. For all minority veterans, we still see too many incomplete exams
and disproportionably lower C&P ratings.

6. Recommend Congress grant the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
permanent status or at a minimum, grant extensions of five year blocks vice
the current three-year extensions.

7. Continue to emphasize and practice a “Customer-centric” approach by VA.
Veterans in general still see VA as cold and uncaring. The culture of “us” (the
VA) and ""them” (the veteran) is still too pervasive throughout VA, especially at
VA Medical Centers, Regional Offices, and CBOC’s.

8. Strongly recommend the Secretary enforce a policy promoting the hiring and
promoting to senior grade levels, talented Minority Veterans.

9. Recommend the Secretary increase outreach to minority veterans concerning
available education benefits. These programs are a critical component of
veteran employment and independence. In our discussions with veterans, we
surmised that only 50 percent of minority veterans utilize Education
Programs. Additionally, continue to raise payment levels for education,
and ensure transitioning veterans are aware of the benefit levels and extend
the time available for the veteran to utilize education benefits. (As a side
note: State approval agencies may have outlived their purpose and money
could be spent in a more useful manner).

10. It is the contention of many veterans and State Directors that job placements
under DVOP’s and LVR’s at the State Labor Department’s do not work. They
are not accountable to anyone and report to no one in most cases. Most
minority veterans that use this service are not placed at all or are placed in
low-level minimum pay jobs.

11.Continue to emphasize, market, and promote opportunities for veteran owned
business as dictated by the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business
Development Act of 1999.

12.Recommend the Secretary mandate the hiring of more veterans in general
and minority veterans specifically, especially in areas of the organization that
serve a high minority veteran population. Upper management at VA does not
reflect the US Veterans Community, and VA’s staffing overall, does not reflect
the minority veteran population served in many regions.

23
",0,0,0,0

Loan Program, but make it easier for Indian veterans to access.

14.Recommend VHA provide mobile vans as “rolling health clinics” for large
Indian Reservations.

15.Recommend VA facilitate Indian veterans’ ability to use IHS with VA picking
up the cost through MOU’s with IHS. The scope should be full medical care
by IHS.

16.Recommend NCA study and pursue the building of War Veterans Homes and
State Veterans Cemeteries on Indian Lands.

17.Strongly recommend that there be increased mental health funding to support
full time mental health staff as active team members at all CBOC/Primary
Care clinics. Literature supports the majority of veterans entering
CBOC/Primary Care clinics are coming to address psychological and social
issues, I.e. it is clear that unless a vet has his/her mental health or substance
abuse problem successfully addressed they can not adequately utilize
benefits or other resources made available. (i.e. housing, job training,
placement and/or any attempt to reach their highest level of function that they
are capable of achieving. (Refer exhibit A)

Department of Veterans Affairs
Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
2002 Annual Report
Recommendations and Responses
Recommendation 1:
Recommend the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans become a permanent
advisory committee to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If permanency is not an
option, recommend renewal for five years. The current committee expiration is
December 2003.
Response:
VA agrees that a five-year extension of the committee is appropriate, and
legislation has been drafted by the Department to authorize such an extension. If
approved by Congress and signed into law, this measure would extend the
Committee through December 2008.
Recommendation 2:
Recommend increased funding of this committee to enable subcommittees to
travel and accept testimony from end users as well as service providers. This
budget should facilitate a minimum of three site visits per year and allow us to
report findings to the committee as a whole at our annual visits.
Response:
The Department is committed to making the necessary funds available to enable
the Committee to meet its statutory obligations. In fact, plans are now being
developed to hold a committee meeting, to include town hall events, in the
southern Rio Grande area of Texas. It’s expected the meeting will occur not later
than mid 2003.
Recommendation 3:
Recommend the VA Human Resources office re-evaluate full time employee
manpower demographics throughout the VA system to better track the hiring and
placement of qualified minority veterans through targeted recruitment.
Response:
VA has established a diversity data system, available on-line from any PC that
can reach the VA intranet. The system provides extensive data regarding the
diversity breakout of the major employment issues, including current employees,
hires, separations, grades and promotions, retirement eligibility, etc. This system
is among the most advanced in government and has been the basis of training to
nearly all Federal agencies, under the auspices of the Council of Federal Equal
Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Civil Rights Executives. The system
includes a breakout of disabilities. The system also compares the representation
32
",0,0,0,0
243,"In individual occupations with the representation in the national relevant civilian
labor force (RCLF). When the 2000 Census data by occupation becomes
available, VA intends to expand the comparisons to include comparisons to the
local labor market.
The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources has worked with the
Administrations and staff offices to create a database and dynamic reporting
program that gives access to important workforce trend data for any of VA's
occupational series for employment of veterans and minorities. The charts show
past, present, and future retirement trends from FY99 to FY06 from the PAID
system database. The program also provides valuable comparisons of VA
employment in specific occupations for minority representation compared to the
civilian labor force, hiring trends and targeted hiring levels to maintain and
Improve minority and veteran representation.
Recommendation 4:
Recommend VA collect data pertaining to small business loan applications in
order to compare different minorities that apply.
Response:
VA does not maintain extensive data on veteran-owned small business loans, but
VA will contact the Administrator of the Small Business Administration requesting
this data and will share the Administrator's response with the Committee at its
next meeting in Washington. It should be noted, however, that VA’s Center for
Veterans Enterprise (CVE) is working with minority veterans to apprise them of
small business services that are available. CVE will gladly brief the Committee
on its work.
Recommendation 5:
(a) Recommend Small Business Administration (SBA) Loan Coordinators be
staffed at VA offices making it more accessible to the minority veteran. (b) The
VA must give us data on policies pertaining to the qualifying factors for vocational
rehabilitation and evaluate the process to help standardize this procedure.
Response:
(a) VA is committed to fully examining the issue of improving minority veterans’
access to SBA services. The placement of SBA loan personnel in VA regional
offices may be an option, but our examination of the access issue should not be
limited to that. The Committee will be briefed at one of its Washington meetings
in 2003 on the results of our examination.
(b) The qualifying factors for vocational rehabilitation are described in the Code
of Federal Regulations, Title 38 CFR Part 21-1 through 21-59, M 28 - 1 Part Il,
and DVB Circular 28-97-1. To insure that the requirements for determining
entitlement to vocational rehabilitation are administered in a standardized
manner, we have instituted a system of quality review to evaluate the accuracy of
33
",0,0,0,0
244,"entitlement determinations. VA Central Office (VACO) staff conducts reviews of
each regional office. Additionally, regional offices are required to review
entitlement decisions to ensure compliance with regulations and policies. The
reviews feed performance indicators that are tied to the evaluation of local
stations and the national program in terms of performance goals. Our current
goal for entitlement accuracy is 92% and the actual performance year to date (FY
2002) is 91%. In addition to the review process, we have initiated a station
survey process to ensure standardization.
Recommendation 6:
Recommend the VA acquire data on companies that are under government
contract to determine if they are hiring minority veteran-owned businesses.
Priority should be given to minority veteran-owned businesses when contracting
for specialized services.
Response:
For contracts exceeding $500,000 (or $1,000,000 for construction), large
businesses are required to submit a plan for subcontracting with small and small
disadvantaged businesses. They subsequently report utilization of Small
Disadvantaged Businesses (SDBs) as subcontractors on Standard Form (SF)
294, Subcontracting Report for Individual Contract Actions, and/or SF 295,
Summary Subcontracting Report. These forms also collect information about
utilization of veteran-owned small businesses (VOSBs) and service-disabled
veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs). The forms do not collect
information about use of businesses that are both SDB and VOSB or SDVOSB.
Currently, there is no procurement preference program for minority veteran-
owned businesses in Federal contracting. However, minority veteran-owned
businesses are eligible for existing Federal procurement preference categories,
including SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program, Historically Underutilized
Business (HUB) Zone Program, Small Disadvantaged Business Program and for
General Services Administration’s Federal Supply Schedules.
Recommendation /:
Public Laws 106-50 and 105-135 establish Veterans Outreach Programs for
business centers to counsel veterans in preparing for business. We recommend
that VA utilize these laws and develop a tracking system to monitor
effectiveness.
Response:
VA established the Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) to implement P.L. 106-
50 and P.L. 106-554. The program results are measured by the number of
veterans and service-disabled veterans who own businesses and by the increase
in Federal business opportunities in prime contracting and in subcontracting.
Agencies report their accomplishments with both veteran-owned small
businesses (VOSBs) and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses

34
",0,0,0,0
245,"(SDVOSBs) to the Federal Procurement Data Center. The annual Federal
Procurement Report contains detailed information about dollars and actions with
these business segments. The report is available on the Internet at
http://www.fpdc.gsa.gov. The increase in the number of veterans and service-
disabled veterans in business is measured by monitoring the firms registered in
SBA’s Pro-Net database.
Recommendation 8:
The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act, passed in August 1999, and the Interim Rule
on Contract Bundling have not been widely publicized in areas where minority
veterans live. What needs to be determined is how businesses and corporations
that have government contracts interact with these programs and if they are
following guidelines when subcontracting veteran owned businesses or hiring
veterans that fall within policy set forth by law.
Response:
This data can be obtained from Standard Form (SF) 294, Subcontracting Report
for Individual Contract Actions; SF-295, Summary Subcontracting Report; and
Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) 100 Reports filed with the
U.S. Department of Labor.
This recommendation is addressed by regulations already in place for acquisition
planning. This includes the appropriate involvement of VA's Office of Small and
Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) and small business
representatives. The acquisition planning process will ensure that inappropriate
bundling does not take place. The intent of this recommendation is a priority of
the VHA Acquisition Board as well as the VA Business Oversight Board that
resulted from the Secretary's Procurement Reform Task Force Report.
Recommendation 9:
Recommend the VA evaluate the new programs in No 7 & 8 and report any
findings that can be used to improve how the SBA administers to minority
veterans.
Response:
VA has in place mechanisms monitoring SBA program effectiveness with regard to
minority veterans. When warranted, VA will make appropriate recommendations to the
SBA Administrator. VA will brief any recommendations made to SBA to the
Committee.
Recommendation 10:
Recommend VA employees receive cultural awareness training to help VA
provide better customer service when processing minority veterans for initial
appointments. Training should cover how to meet, greet, and inform each
veteran of the enrollment process, treatment, and services. Further training will
35
",0,0,0,0
246,"aide VA employees in recognizing cultural/ethnic/health differences within the
minority veterans community.
Response:
All of VA's administrations are working to improve cultural awareness. In VHA,
special training modules have been developed and are being developed, to
enhance the delivery of specialized care (such as PTSD treatment) to various
minority veterans groups. As discussed in the responses to Recommendations
#11 and #12, VHA is seeking to make the enrollment process more user friendly
for minority veterans by providing translator services and making the enrollment
paperwork more familiar to minority veterans. VHA is also attempting to address
the issue by creating and capitalizing on a more diverse workforce.
In VBA, employee demographics are routinely reviewed to effectively track the
hiring and placement of qualified minority applicants. Each regional office
annually develops an action plan to increase minority employment in specific
target areas. Regional offices also share “best practices” in enhancing
promotional opportunities for minorities. Special emphasis is placed upon
minority hiring/training in technical jobs within the Veterans Service Centers
where contact with initial claim filers is greatest.
The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is prototyping a Diversity
Management Program that is designed to help management build cohesion and
assist with the complex mission of serving veterans. The program consists of
quarterly small group discussions (2 hours) led by experienced facilitators. The
training methodology includes interactive seminars and video presentations
followed by discussions and case study and scenario solving. The goal of the
program is to orient employees to how diversity impacts workforce cohesion and
mission accomplishment.
Recommendation 11:
Recommend VA implement a fast track enrollment system for initial medical
appointments with specialists who have training in documentation required by VA
to aide veterans in proper enrollment, thus expediting receipt of medical care. In
some areas of the country, Spanish speaking specialists, Native Americans and
other minority representatives may be required.
Response:
VA has several tools available to assist veterans in applying for enrollment and
for requesting initial medical appointments. VA health care facilities have
established mechanisms for obtaining translator services when needed for
veteran interaction. These services are available through a combination of
internal resources and contractual arrangements. VA's national health benefits
call center, the Health Benefits Service Center, has staff available to assist
Spanish-speaking veterans. The health benefits application form, VA Form 10-
10EZ, is available on the VA website, www.va.gov. An assessment of the

36
",0,0,0,0
247,"potential need to establish a Spanish version of the health benefits application on
this website has been initiated based upon this recommendation.
Recommendation 12:
Recommend VA develop a more culturally diverse employment practice within
the VA medical system. Each VA Medical Center, its management and
administrative executives, as well as medical professionals and staff, should be
representative of the population of the veterans’ community it serves.
Response:
VHA already has a number of strategic mechanisms in place to support diversity
employment improvement. First, the Under Secretary for Health’s Diversity
Advisory Board exists to help create and capitalize on a diverse workforce. It is
VHA's strategic aim to strengthen VHA's competitive advantage by being more
adaptive and creative in meeting the needs of the patients, staff and
stakeholders. This Board exists to address issues affecting diversity in the
workplace and to advise the Under Secretary for Health and VHA’s senior
management on issues affecting workplace diversity; thereby ensuring VHA
becomes an employer of choice. Finally, VHA continues to firmly support and
adhere to priority employment for veterans. VHA will continue to seek out
additional opportunities to support employment opportunities for veterans,
particularly minority veterans.
Recommendation 13:
Recommend VA establish a Center for Excellence focusing on dust-induced lung
disease to ensure proper medical treatment and diagnosis in reference to
Information Letter (IL 10-99-004). This position requires a trained medical
physician/specialist in the areas of environmental medicine dealing with dust-
induced lung diseases of former Navy and Marine Corps personnel exposed to
deck grinding.
Response:
VHA does not agree with this recommendation because the necessary expertise
currently is available at many VA medical centers and consultative assistance is
available from the field-based Program Director for Pulmonary Diseases and the
Director of Occupational Health in the VA Central Office.
Recommendation 14:
Recommend that dust-induced lung disease be included as of one of the ten
educational modules under the Veterans Health Initiative Program for fiscal year
2003.
Response:
VA agrees with this recommendation. A Veterans Health Initiative (VHI) module
on occupational lung diseases associated with military service is being
developed. The target date for completion of the module is September 30, 2003.
37
",0,0,0,0
248,"Recommendation 15:
Recommend VA medical centers ensure adequate transportation be provided for
those minority and/or low-income veterans residing in rural areas. Implement a
Departure Tracking System to expedite transported veterans through their
medical visits.
Response:
In conjunction with Disabled American Veterans, VHA has an established
transportation network involving 179 VA health care facilities. This network
provides transportation services for veterans in need of transportation to and
from a Department health care facility. In addition to this service, VA reimburses
low-income veterans for certain travel related expenses. Low-income is defined
as any veteran whose income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of
pension. The law does not permit VA to base eligibility for travel assistance or
reimbursement on a veteran’s ethnic background. In response to the
recommendation to implement a Departure Tracking System, VHA will need to
evaluate this recommendation further.
Recommendation 16:
Recommend VHA review and update policies that establish Community Based
Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) and Vet Center locations relative to rural areas and the
needs of veterans living in outlying areas.
Response:
In 2001, VHA reviewed and updated its policies for establishing Community-
Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC). The current policy outlines the goals for
establishment of CBOCs. The first goal is to improve access to current users by
placing CBOCs in those areas where current users travel significant distances.
The current policy also includes criteria for planning and establishing CBOCs.
These criteria include factors that address the needs of veterans living in rural
areas, including distance from existing VA sites and unique considerations, such
as medically underserved or health manpower shortage areas, mountainous or
desert areas, low population density, etc.
To augment Vet Center services in rural areas, Readjustment Counseling
Service (RCS) administers a private sector contract program and a Vet Center
Tele-Health Program. The former provides readjustment counseling in outlying
areas to serve those veterans that live some distance from existing Vet Centers.
The latter program features telemedicine technology installed in 20 Vet Centers
to promote access to VHA primary care and mental health for under-served
veterans living in inner-city and/or remote rural areas. Four of these Tele-Health
sites are sites are located on Native American reservation lands. Annual Vet
Center quality reviews monitor and evaluate the adequacy of the Vet Center’s
location in the community as well as veteran client demographics to ensure that
high-risk veterans are provided outreach and treatment at levels equal to or

38
",0,0,0,0
249,"greater than their representation in the local veteran community. RCS monitors
this issue via the annual veteran client satisfaction survey, which includes a
question about the convenience of the Vet Center location.
Recommendation 17:
Recommend psychiatric care be provided at every CBOC to ensure that a full
curriculum of services is offered to every veteran, especially in rural areas.
Response:
VHA has addressed this issue over the past fiscal year. In August 2001,
Networks were directed to develop a plan to improve the consistency with which
VHA provides mental health services in existing and proposed new Community-
Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Such services were to be provided in all
CBOCs other than by exception. It is believed that the larger the CBOC the more
crucial it is that meaningful access for mental heath services be provided.
Networks were informed that Mental Health services should include the capacity
to provide medication management and general counseling or psychotherapy
services for all patients requiring such services. Since demand for mental health
services is generally proportionate to demand for primary care services, the
smaller CBOCs would need proportionately less staffing, but should still provide
convenient access to mental health care. This initial planning process was
completed Sept 28, 2001. By March 27, 2002, plans for including Mental Health
in CBOCs were completed and approved for all VISNs. The Third Quarter review
of plan milestones against timelines for each VISN were critiqued by subject
experts and approved by August 12, 2002. Ongoing quarterly reviews of VISN
timelines will continue until all plans are completed.
Recommendation 18:
As mandated by law, Committee members must make periodic site visits to VA
Medical Centers throughout the United States. The committee must adhere to
PL 103-446 by congressional mandate. Due to budgetary constraints, no site
visits are scheduled during the balance of fiscal year 2002 and the entire fiscal
year 2003. An immediate increase or amendment of the current budget is
requested. Increasing the budget in fiscal year 2004 will allow for continued site
visits.
Response:
The Department is committed to making the necessary funds available to enable
the Committee to meet its statutory obligations. In fact, plans are now being
developed to hold a committee meeting, to include town hall events, in the
southern Rio Grande area of Texas. The meeting is occurring in May 2003.
Recommendation 19:
That the Undersecretary for Health establishes an outreach program to inform
former military personnel who served in aircraft carriers and other naval vessels
of potential health problems related to dust induced lung disease.

39
",0,0,0,0
250,"Response:
VHA has previously conducted an outreach program including sending letters to
individual identified veterans and Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs).
Current and future plans are focused on further educating VA staff, including staff
of the Transition Assistance Program, so they can better inform and advise
potentially exposed veterans.
Recommendation 20:
Recommend the Secretary direct and resource outreach programs in minority
communities by Minority Veteran Program Coordinators (MVPC) concerning
enrollment and other VA benefits.
Response:
This would require program funding and the creation of a position specifically for
an MVPC. Currently, MVPCs are VA employees that hold other full time
positions in the Department who have been tasked with the additional duty of
being the MVPC for their facility. The additional cost of the MVPC program is
currently borne by each facility. Further study is currently ongoing to determine
the appropriate level of resourcing for the program VA wide. Currently, more
than 260 MVPs are in place.
Recommendation 21:
Establish a recruitment and hiring goal to increase the numbers of bilingual
minority veterans’ health care providers.
Response:
VHA has already established relationships with Hispanic-serving institutions to
increase the number of bilingual minority veterans’ health care providers. VHA
participates in the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU)
Summer Internship Program and also the Student Experience Program for the
purpose of attracting talented minorities from minority institutions.
Recommendation 22:
Hire more minorities as ratings/claims officers. This would be a step towards
raising VA sensitivities to the needs of minority veterans pursuing disability
claims.
Response:
The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) routinely reviews manpower
demographics to better track the hiring and placement of qualified minority
applicants. On an annual basis, each VBA regional office completes an
Affirmative Employment Program (AEP) Report that contains an analysis of
workforce data and an action plan to increase representation in specific target
areas. In FYO2, there were 1,142 new hires, 120 conversions, and 21 other

40
",0,0,0,0
251,"gains for a total of 1,283 gains. Of these gains, 42.87% were from groups in
underrepresented occupations (including women).
VBA uses the Outstanding Scholar Program, the Federal Career Intern Program
and Merit Promotion Announcements to recruit and promote minorities to critical
technical positions within VBA. Many of these positions are within the Veterans
Service Center, one of the largest divisions within many of our regional offices.
In addition to completing the AEP report, regional offices complete an annual
report on Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action Programs (DVAAP) certifying that
they have developed a plan for recruiting and hiring veterans and increasing the
representation of veterans within specific positions.
Recommendation 23:
Continue to develop and improve the delivering of benefits to minority veterans,
with a focus toward ensuring that minorities are aware that they are entitled to file
a claim.
Response:
The MVPC program directs every VA facility to have a Minority Program
Coordinator (MVPC) in place to conduct outreach to minority veterans and
facilitate the communication of benefits and services available to minority
veterans. There are currently over 260 MVPCs VA wide.
Additionally, VA has begun a Tribal Veteran Representative (TVR) training
program that trains identified individuals living on tribal lands on VA services and
benefits. The TVRs are liaisons between the VA and veterans living on tribal
lands. After training, the TVR will be able to assist the veteran with claims
submissions and follow-up as well as provide veterans living on tribal land with
information on VA services and benefits available to them.
Recommendation 24:
VA should partner with Department of Defense (DoD) to develop a more
accurate disability determination process at the DoD level, thus obviating the
need for a second evaluation through the VA appeal process. This would help to
alleviate the VA appeal backlog and expedite services to the veteran.
Response:
VA recently began its Benefits Delivery at Discharge program at the Pentagon's
DiLorenzo TRICARE clinic, adding to the growing number of sites where active
duty military members due to separate or retire can receive one physical for both
discharge and VA's disability claim actions. In many cases, these new veterans
will know if their VA disability claim has been approved before they leave active
duty.
Recommendation 25:

41
",0,0,0,0
252,"Recommend VA doctors receive more sensitivity training specifically related to
culture care diversity.
Response:
Employee Education System (EES) has three Employee Education Resource
Centers (EERCs) devoted to clinical education efforts. These Centers will be
asked to work closely with appropriate VHA offices to develop training related to
culture care diversity for clinicians. One example of this is the series of Post
Traumatic stress Disorder modules being created for minority veterans groups.
Recommendation 26:
Recommend continued emphasis on a “customer-centric” approach by VBA.
Response:
As mentioned above, VBA uses the Outstanding Scholar Program, the Federal
Career Intern Program and Merit Promotion Announcements to obtain a list of
best-qualified candidates for critical technical positions within VBA. Many of
these positions are within the Veterans Service Center, one of the largest
divisions within many of our regional offices. The hiring of minorities and
veterans will ensure a culture sensitive to the needs of our veteran population.
Minority Veteran Program Coordinators at the regional offices contribute to a
customer-centric approach through outreach efforts such as the Honolulu
Regional Office with their monthly visits to Maui, Kauai, Hilo and Kona and
Nashville Regional Office’s arrangement of a Hispanic Benefit Fair and
attendance at Native American events. Anchorage Regional Office has
appointed four minority veteran coordinators who are Hispanic, Asian-Pacific
Islander, Filipino and African-American.
Recommendation 27:
Strongly recommend the Secretary enforce a policy promoting the hiring and
promoting to senior grade levels, talented minority veterans.
Response:
The Office of Diversity Management and Equal Employment Opportunity
(DM&EEO) has established new formats for presenting data about race, national
origin, gender, veteran status and disability. DM&EEO has published a baseline
analysis, ""FY01 Workforce Change"" and made it available on their web site.
DM&EEO has also distributed a training video on how to use the data system, ""A
Guide to Conducting Workforce Analysis"", which has been repeatedly broadcast
throughout VA. In addition, DM&EEO has provided on-site training in many
facilities. This analysis provides an objective foundation for the SES
performance standard regarding EEO/Diversity. DM&EEO also provides charts
for the Monthly Performance Review, chaired by the Deputy Secretary. The
result is that the Administration's employment practices are reviewed at the
highest level on a frequent basis.

42
",0,0,0,0
253,"Recommendation 28:
Recommend the Secretary increase outreach to minority veterans concerning
available education benefits. Continue to raise payment levels for education,
ensure transitioning veterans are aware of the benefit levels and extend the time
available for the veteran to utilize education benefits.
Response:
The Education Service within the Veterans Benefits Administration is taking
action to increase outreach efforts to veterans including minority veterans. We
currently mail education benefit information to potentially eligible active duty
personnel upon completion of their first 12 months of active duty and after the
required $1200 pay reduction. In September 2002, a separate mailing to
potentially eligible active duty personnel who have completed 24 months of
active duty was conducted. The 24-month gate is the point in time they first
become eligible to utilize the benefit while on active duty.
Another outreach effort is made through our web site, www.gibill.va.gov. User
friendly frequently asked questions software, Right Now Web, was installed on
our web site in September 2002. This software enables veterans to quickly find
answers to their questions regarding eligibility, benefits, approved programs and
other information.
Public Law 107-103, The Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of
2001, increased the rates for full-time Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30) benefits
from $672 to $800 effective January 1, 2002; $900 effective October 1, 2002;
and $985 effective October 1, 2003.
Recommendation 29:
Continue to emphasize, market, and promote opportunities for veteran owned
business as dictated by the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business
Development Act of 1999.
Response:
This is presently being accomplished through initiatives by VA's Center for
Veteran’s Enterprise (CVE), which include: outreach conferences, establishment
of a veteran database, newsletters, training of contracting officers and a

Recommendation 30:
Recommend the Secretary mandate the hiring of more veterans in general and
minority veterans specifically, especially in areas of the organization that serve a
high minority veteran population.

43
",0,0,0,0
254,"Response:
While hiring quotas are not permitted in Federal employment settings, VA does
actively support and defend veterans’ preference and equal employment
opportunity for all in Federal hiring. Additionally, each medical center and
network director's performance plan includes a performance element regarding
improved affirmative employment for all minorities, including veterans. Medical
centers develop an annual plan for the hiring of disabled veterans and then
submit annual accomplishments reports on hiring veterans through the
Accomplishments Report of the National Disabled Veterans Affirmative Action
Program. Each medical center submits an annual report to the Office of the
Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration, which then
submits a consolidated report to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
The minority hiring programs managed by VBA are summarized in the responses
to Recommendations #22 and #26.
Additionally, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and
Administration and the Administrations and staff offices have created a database
and dynamic reporting program that gives access to important workforce trend
data for any of VA's occupational series for employment of veterans and
minorities. The charts present past, present, and future retirement trends from
FY99 to FY06 from the PAID system database. The program also provides
valuable comparisons of VA employment in specific occupations for minority
representation compared to the civilian labor force, hiring trends, and targeted
hiring levels to maintain and improve minority and veteran representation. This
information assists facilities and Networks in identifying veteran and minority
populations by specific occupation for employment outreach.
VA’s National Veterans Employment Program focuses on assisting veterans in
their efforts to obtain employment using their veteran preference status. The
program also focuses on outreach to veterans and active military personnel
through job fairs and military transition centers to develop a pool of highly
qualified candidates to fill critical vacancies throughout the Department. NVEP is
also responsible for ensuring that the Department's HR specialists, managers
and selecting officials are aware of veterans preference guidelines and that they
extend to eligible veterans opportunities afforded under the Veterans
Employment Opportunities Act of 1998, Public Law 105-339.

VBA Its currently exploring avenues to expand outreach to Native American
tribes, including an analysis of whether to increase loan amounts. Additionally,
VBA is completing the annual Report to Congress on the Native American
Veteran Direct Loan Pilot Program for FY 2002 that will be briefed to the
Committee once it has been finalized.

Recommendation 32:

Recommend VHA provide mobile vans as “rolling health clinics” for large Indian
Reservations.

Response:

VHA has found mobile vans are not as effective as establishing Community
Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs), sharing agreements or contractual
arrangements with IHS providers to provide necessary services to Indian
Reservations. Currently, VHA has 22 sharing agreements or contracts with IHS
or individual Indian tribes. These services are provided with Indian tribes located
in the states of Alaska, Arizona, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon,
Southern California, South Dakota and Washington. In addition, a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) is being developed by the Indian Health Service and
VHA to further encourage cooperation and resource sharing. The Committee will
be briefed about the MOU once it is signed.

Recommendation 33:

Recommend VA facilitate Indian veterans’ ability to use IHS with VA picking up
the cost through MOU’s with IHS. The scope should be full medical care by IHS.
Response:

The Department of Veterans Affairs and the Indian Health Service have signed a
Memorandum of Understanding to effect the above recommendation. Under the
MOU, VA and IHS will work towards the mutual goals of:

1. Improving beneficiary's access to quality healthcare and services.

2. Improving communication between VA, Native American veterans and
tribal governments with IHS' assistance.

3. Encouraging partnerships and sharing agreements between VHA
headquarters and facilities, IHS headquarters and facilities, and tribal
governments in support of Native American veterans.

State Veterans Cemeteries on Indian Lands.
Response:
Although the recommendation calls for an NCA study of war veteran’s homes,
NCA has no jurisdiction over the state veterans home program. The Committee
will receive a briefing on state veterans homes in a future meeting to explain the
program and any initiatives that may be ongoing.
Regarding the issue of pursuing veteran’s cemeteries on Native Indian Lands,
the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is actively pursuing and working
with Tribal leaders and others to ensure that this issue becomes reality. Two
examples are noted below:
NCA is working with the States of Arizona and New Mexico as well as with the
Navajo Nation to establish a veteran’s cemetery within reasonable access for
most Navajo veterans in that area. The States are sensitive to the needs of
Native American veterans and have said that such a cemetery would be located
within the Four Sacred Mountains that define traditional Navajo lands. The
States would work with Native Americans to ensure that burial customs can be
observed in the state cemetery.
Additionally, NCA is exploring the establishment of a Native American veteran
cemetery within the Ft. Sill Oklahoma National Cemetery environs. NCA is
committed to working with tribal leaders, VA’s Office of Minority Affairs, and other
applicable governmental entities and stakeholders to ensure a positive outcome
to this effort.

259,"Activity Report

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) is in its ninth year
as a standing committee. Congress tasked the committee with providing advice
to the Secretary with respect to the administration of benefits for veterans who
are minority group members.

The committee met twice during this reporting period. The committee
convened in Washington DC, 20 — 22 November 2002, for its annual
administrative meeting. Its annual field trip was taken 12-16 May 2003 in
Harlingen, Texas. The committee met tts legislated obligations with these two
meetings.

The reporting period was marked by the departure of nine members of the
committee whose terms had expired. The resulting turnover of almost fifty
percent of the committee included the departure of the Chairman.

Washington, DC Meeting

The first meeting of the reporting period, held in Washington, DC was
primarily administrative in nature. Major events of the meeting were the
appointment of the new Chair, Mr. Joey Strickland, by Secretary Principi and the
review of the Department’s responses to the committee’s recommendations from
their 2002 annual report. The committee members received briefings from the
department heads responsible with responding to each of the committee’s
recommendations. The major outcome of the meeting was a consensus to focus
future field trips taken by the committee on the delivery of benefits to veterans
residing in primarily rural areas, many of which are minorities. Additionally, the
committee would continue to evaluate the Department of Veteran’s Affairs
performance in the following areas that were major topics of concern in the 2002
Annual Report:

1. The Department’s development and implementation of cultural
sensitivity training with an emphasis on empathetic treatment of
minority veterans. The increased awareness of cultural differences
among veterans should lead to an increase in the hiring of persons
of different ethnicities and bilingual capabilities.

2. How the Department enables effective and efficient enrollment of
minority veterans as first time entrants into the VA healthcare
system. Again, part and parcel of this enhanced enrollment
process should include the hiring of persons of different ethnicities
and bilingual capabilities able to relate to the diverse veteran
population.

3. How the Department ensures its employment practices develop
diverse staffs throughout the agency, with special emphasis on
ensuring diversity at the upper management and executive
leadership levels.

3
",0,0,0,0
260,"4. How the Department ensures the improvement of delivery of
benefits to minority veterans, especially with regard to outreach to
minority veterans on available benefits and claims filing.

5. The continuation of the Native American Direct Home Loan
Program with an emphasis on making the application process
easier and ensuring funds are available.

6. Ensuring that travel funds are provided for the Committee to visit
field sites so that they may better evaluate the above-mentioned
priorities.

With regard to item six, the committee was able to travel to a remote site to begin
its long-term focus on the delivery of benefits to rural veterans. The Department
made available the requisite funds for the committee to engage in a regular
program of travel that currently projects two site visits a year with an additional
third administrative meeting to be held in Washington DC.

Harlingen, Texas Meeting

The committee met with senior VA officials tasked with management of VA
benefits and services delivery to South Texas veterans, local healthcare
providers, veterans’ service organizations and veterans.

The field visit to Harlingen, Texas 12 —16 May is the first in what the
committee hopes to be a series of field visits to rural areas of the country over
the next few years. The intent is to learn about the challenges and obstacles
rural minority veterans face when accessing benefits and services from the
Department of Veterans Affairs.

The committee met with several stakeholders concerned with the delivery
of VA Healthcare and Benefits to the veterans residing in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley (LRGV). Participants from the Department of Veterans Affairs included
Dr. Frances Murphy, Deputy Undersecretary for Health Policy Coordination;
Thomas R. Wagner, Director VA Regional Office, Houston and his acting Veteran
Service Counselor Manager John Ballenger; Thomas J. Stranova, Director VA
Heart Of Texas Health Care Network (VISN 17) and his Business Development
Manager Mike Dunfee; as well as John Mendoza, Chief Business Office/Medical
Administration Service and Vicki Hannigan, M.D., Associate Chief of Staff for
Ambulatory Care, both from the South Texas Veterans Health Care System.

Discussed were initiatives taken by VISN 17 and the South Texas
Veterans Health Care System to increase access to VA medical care for the
veterans of the Lower Rio Grande Valley to include the opening of community
based outpatient clinics (CBOC) and the implementation of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley (LRGV) Ambulatory Surgery and Inpatient Program. The LRGV
Ambulatory Surgery and Inpatient Program was created in April of 1998 to serve
veterans receiving primary care services from the McAllen VA Outpatient Clinic
(MCOPC) or Brownsville Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). This
program alleviates the need of the veteran to travel long distances to San

4
",0,0,0,0
261,"Antonio for routine, non-urgent ambulatory procedures. Since the program's
inception, there have been over 5,000 referrals. Only veterans receiving primary
care from a VA contract or staff physician at either the Brownsville CBOC or
MCOPC are eligible for this program and a referral from their VA primary care
physician is required for these services.

The McAllen VA Outpatient Clinic, established in 1972, began as an
outpatient facility housed in a trailer. In 1978, the clinic relocated, from the trailer,
to a structure of approximately 5,000 square feet. After continuous workload
increase and the need for more space, a new facility was built and leased to the
VA for use by the clinic. This facility, consisting of approximately 27,000 square
feet, opened in August 19971. It is located 250 miles from the parent facility, Audie
L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital, located in San Antonio, Texas. The clinic
area of availability encompasses the seven southern counties of Texas and is
comprised of approximately 40,000 veterans. During the winter, the veteran
population increases significantly due to the influx of winter visitors to the area.

Primary Care Services are provided at the clinic. These services include
medical, psychiatry, psychology, geriatric endocrinology, urology, surgical,
podiatry, gynecology and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Ancillary services provided at
the clinic are pharmacy, physical therapy, laboratory, radiology, social service
and dietary. Additionally, the Clinic in conjunction with the South Texas Family
Practice Residency program in McAllen and with the University of Texas Health
Science Center at San Antonio participates in teaching family practice residents.
This program includes third and fourth year medical students.

In addition to the above, The South Texas Veterans Health Care System
(STVHCS) began contracting with local primary care providers in 1997 to
improve the access to health care services for veterans closer to their home or
work. These clinics were established to provide primary care to the veteran in
their community and are contract Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs).
These clinics are by enrollment only. The following are the contract community-
based outpatients clinics in South Texas: Alice, Texas (established September
1998), Beeville, Texas (established September 1998), Brownsville, Texas
(established October 1998), Kingsville, Texas (established September 1998),
Uvalde, Texas (established January 1999).

Enhanced services are also provided through Telecare and Telemed.

Telecare - Telephone Liaison Care (Telecare) provides telephone medical advice
to veterans of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System. The service has
bilingual capability and provides prompt, reliable and courteous answers to
patient's questions. Veteran-patients and their family members can access the
service via a toll-free number. Telemed — is a 24-hour telephone refill service,
also accessible via a toll free phone number.

In work at the time of the meeting is a plan to replace the Brownsville
contract CBOC with a new health service contract provider located in Harlingen
Texas. This would put the health care service in a more central location

Ss)
",0,0,0,0
262,"providing closer care for both Harlingen and Brownsville veterans and potentially
reducing the patient load on the McAllen CBOC.

For major surgeries and clinical specialties not offered at the Lower Rio
Grande Valley (LRGV) CBOCs, veterans must travel to the Audie L. Murphy
Memorial Veterans Hospital, located in San Antonio, Texas. This represents a
three to four hour drive in one direction for veterans, many of whom do not have
transportation or funds for overnight lodging should their appointment schedule
require it. This is especially difficult for the veterans of advanced age and with
disabilities.

Of equal interest were the initiatives undertaken by the Regional Office of
the Veterans Benefits Administration in Houston, Texas. The Houston Regional
Office (RO) is the fourth largest of 58 Regional Offices based on number of
personnel. The jurisdiction of the Houston RO includes the 90 counties in the
southern half of Texas, the Republic of Mexico, Central and South America, and
the Caribbean. The regional office serves as the regional loan center
responsible for loan origination, loan administration in Texas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Arkansas. The approximate number of veterans served is
788,000. The Regional Office has additional staff based at Fort Sam Houston in
San Antonio, the VA outpatient clinic in Corpus Christi and the VA outpatient
clinic in McAllen. Specifically McAllen has one veteran service representative,
one counseling psychologist, and one vocational rehabilitation counselor.
Corpus Christi’s out-based regional office is staffed with one veteran service
representative, two vocational rehabilitation counselors and one loan service
representative.

Houston Regional Office has implemented several performance initiatives
that have directly impacted the turnaround time for benefits claims. Currently,
Houston RO claims adjudicators average 127 days to turnaround veterans
claims, well below the VBA established goal of 165 days. Ten percent of
veterans appeal their ratings. Director, Regional Office Houston recently
received President’s Quality Award for his superb stewardship.

The committee spoke to Veteran Service Organizations and held a town
hall meeting with area veterans. Both groups voiced similar concerns which are
easily defined into two major issues: (1) Transportation to the Audie L. Murphy
Memorial Veterans Hospital, located in San Antonio, Texas and to the community
based outpatient clinics in the Lower Rio Grande Valley Area and (2) A desire for
future planning by VHA to incorporate increased access to healthcare services
using commercially available healthcare providers in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley in lieu of referral to the Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital. The
committee discussed these concerns with the representatives from VISN 17 and
the South Texas Veterans Health Care System.

Issue 1: /ransportation to the Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital,
located in San Antonio, Texas and to the community based outpatient clinics in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley Area

6
",0,0,0,0
263,"Currently there is no transportation system available in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley service area for the transporting of ambulatory or disabled
veterans to and from local area VA outpatient clinics. The current Disabled
American Veteran's (DAV) transportation networks are solely for transporting
valley veterans to the Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital (ALMMVH) in
San Antonio. This service is only available twice a week and the 15-passenger
van is not outfitted for transporting disabled veterans. It is upwards of 600 miles
roundtrip to ALMMVH making this an extremely arduous journey for ailing
veterans, especially the many elderly veterans currently in their 60s, 70s and 80s
who are frequent users of the DAV transportation network. Veterans accessing
the McAllen and Brownsville CBOCs for their primary care may have to travel up
to 120 miles. Public transportation in the LRGV is inadequate to nonexistent for
reliable use by veterans wishing to travel to the available CBOCs thus making
personal transportation a requirement for consistent access to local VA
healthcare services.

The Rio Grande Valley Veteran’s Transportation Committee is addressing
the lack of local transportation. The committee is striving for the development of
a non-profit transportation corporation dedicated to providing point-to-point
transport of veterans from their homes to their VA healthcare appointments in the
local area. John Mendoza, Chief Business Office/Medical Administration Service
from the South Texas Veterans Health Care System, provides a VA presence on
the committee. Other members of the committee includes members from
Congressman Ortiz’s local office, local business organizations, veterans groups
and other stakeholders seeking avenues for improving access to VA local health
providers for veterans residing in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

Issue 2: A desire for future planning by VHA to incorporate increased access to
healthcare services using commercially available healthcare providers in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley in lieu of referral to the Audie L. Murphy Memorial
Veterans Hospital

Many of the veterans indicated that a more robust VA presence in the
LRGV was the only way to address the identified healthcare access issues.
Replacing Audie L. Murphy Memorial Veterans Hospital (ALMMVH) in San
Antonio, as the preeminent healthcare provider for LRGV veterans medical
needs with local healthcare providers, was the resounding desired resolution
among LRGV veterans. VISN 17 has begun to address these concerns by
negotiating a contract for health services with the Regional Academic Health
Center (RAHC), which is an extension campus of the University of Texas Health
Science Center at San Antonio for the Lower Rio Grande Valley, located in
Harlingen, Texas. The establishment of a CBOC affiliated with the RAHC will
provide a more centralized health provider that will augment the McAllen CBOC
primary care facility. Current plans are to close down the Brownsville CBOC,
which is not favored by the mostly Hispanic veteran population living in the
Brownsville area. With contractual specifics for the CBOC at Harlingen still in
work, there may be an opportunity to keep the Brownsville CBOC open pending
review of the veteran population’s healthcare needs.

7
",0,0,0,0
264,"Other opportunities exist for providing expanded healthcare delivery in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley through the Dolly Vinsant Hospital (which currently is
contracted for limited ambulatory care by the South Texas Veterans Health Care
System) and the Valley Baptist Medical Center (VBMC) which is the primary
referral hospital for comprehensive and subspecialty care in South Texas. This
450-bed general hospital and Level II| Trauma Center provides state-of-the-art
medical, surgical, obstetric, and pediatric care. Capabilities include medical,
cardiovascular, surgical, neurological, and newborn/pediatric intensive care; air
ambulance transportation; cardiac catheterization with interventional and
electrophysiology capabilities; active cardiovascular, general, neurosurgical,
ophthalmic, orthopedic, plastic, and urological surgery services; pulmonary and
gastrointestinal endoscopy; hemodialysis; outpatient multispecialty diabetes care;
wound care services; and hospice care. VBMC's rehabilitation facility provides
Inpatient and outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and
speech/language therapy. Radiology services include CT, MRI, sonography,
nuclear medicine, interventional radiology, and radiation therapy. It is associated
with the RACH as well. Clearly this facility could provide most of veterans’
specialty care needs thus precluding the need for grueling five hour drives to San
Antonio for care.
Conclusions

VISN 17 has begun to address the pressing healthcare needs of the
LRGV veterans. The overall concern for veterans is access to quality healthcare.
We strongly urge VISN 17 to aggressively pursue agreements and joint ventures
with local healthcare providers that would provide easily accessible healthcare
for the growing LGRV veterans. In the interim, continuing to collaborate with the
Rio Grande Valley Veteran’s Transportation Committee for a short-term solution
addressing veterans’ transportation needs is paramount. We encourage the
Director of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System to continue to support
the efforts of this committee to ensure adequate access to quality healthcare for
all veterans under his jurisdiction.

277,"Activity Report

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) is in its tenth year as a standing
committee. Congress tasked the committee with providing advice to the Secretary with respect to the
administration of benefits for veterans who are minority group members.

The committee met twice during this reporting period convening in Seattle, Washington on
September 23-25, 2003 and in New Orleans, Louisiana on May 4-6, 2004. The committee met its
legislated obligations with these two meetings.

The committee used similar formats for the conduct of their meetings in Seattle and New
Orleans. Using a “360 Degree” look, they communicated with the leadership of the VA facilities in the
area visited which included the Veterans Integrated Network System (VISN) director, the Veterans
Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) director, the Veterans Affairs Regional Office (VARO) director and the
National Cemetery director. The committee also met with stakeholders concerned about the delivery
of benefits and healthcare to veterans. Invitations were offered to Veterans Service Organizations,
State representatives as well as the Minority Veteran Program Coordinators (MVPCs), patient
advocates and other personnel involved in the MVPCs outreach to minority veterans. Town hall
meetings were also held allowing the committee to complete its review by interacting directly with
minority veterans.

Rural minority veterans continue to be of particular interest to the committee as these veterans
express difficulty accessing VA benefits and services as well as present unique outreach challenges
to the VA. The committee ensured a town hall meeting was held in rural locales at each of their site
visits thus providing a voice to veterans in rural America.

Chairman Joey Strickland’s comments and recommendations concerning the committees’
findings follow.

Seattle, Washington

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) met in Seattle, Washington on
September 23-25, 2003. The following areas of concern were our main focus for the field visit:

e VISN 20’s direction pertaining to the CARES process in consolidating its realignment of
capital assets.

e Access to health care for veterans in remote areas

e Status and number of community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) in Washington State

e Status of wellness clinics

e How the Memorandum of Agreement between Indian Health Services (IHS) and VA is
working.

e VA's outreach programs to minority veterans and rural veterans

e Regional Office processing of minority veteran’s benefits claims

e Utilization of the Direct Home Loan Program for American Indian veterans residing on
tribal lands

",0,0,0,0
278,"During three days of meetings with senior VA officials, Congressional staff members, Veteran
Service Organizations and other interested stakeholders the committee noted several issues of
interest. Their comments and recommendations follow.

Committee Comment:
VISN 20 Director, Dr. Les Burger and Puget Sound VA Medical Center Director, Mr. Timothy Williams
chaired the leadership panel. It was apparent that neither Dr. Burger nor Mr. Williams had a grasp of
quantitative data regarding racial composition of minority veterans’ issues. Both also appeared
unprepared for the committee review of minority veterans’ issues. Additionally, Mr. Williams, by his
own admission, appointed a Minority Veteran Coordinator (MVPC) the day prior to our arrival.
However, he had not met the individual, nor knew the MVPC’s name—but to his surprise and ours,
the MVPC was seated behind him.
VA Note:
Mr. Williams provided the committee with the ethnic representation in Western Washington compared
to 2003 ethnic patient representation at VA Puget Sound HCS thus responding to the committee’s
request for quantitative data on minority veterans accessing his facility. He also provided a detailed
description of the Cultural Sensitivity training employees undergo and the outreach the facility
conducts to minority veterans thus answering the committee’s questions.
Committee Comment:
The endorsement of Camp Chaparral by the VISN 20 leadership was seen as a positive and
proactive support for cultural sensitivity. Specifically, this program teaches tolerance and
understanding of the Yakama Indian culture and is especially designed for non-Indian VA employees
serving Indian veterans. The ACMV was very impressed with the results achieved by Camp
Chaparral and recommends VA central office continue funding and support of this program.
VA Note:
Camp Chaparral continues to be funded by the VA and the annual cultural sensitivity training is
ongoing. Additionally, the Employee Education System is working to further develop cultural
competence training for VA staff to better serve the American Indian/Alaska native veterans and their
families.
Committee Comment:
Walla Walla VA Medical Center is a crucial medical facility for veterans in the Eastern Washington
area. Closing or even severe reduction of inpatient capacity of this facility will negatively impact
veterans’ healthcare and require a three to four hour drive to the Seattle VAMC.
VA Note:
The Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) Commission concurred with the
closing of inpatient medical services at Walla Walla but only if the following occurs:

4
",0,0,0,0
279,"(a) before taking action to alter existing VA services, VA must ensure that there are viable
alternatives in the community;

(bo) VA to ensure that it has quality criteria and procedures for contracting and monitoring
service delivery, as well as the availability of trained staff to negotiate cost-effective
contracts.

Committee Recommendation #1

Strongly advise establishing additional CBOCs throughout Washington State. The impression of the
committee is that veteran’s in the rural regions of the state are severely underserved.

Committee Comment:

During the town hall meeting, several African American women veterans indicated sensitivity issues
at the American Lake Medical Clinic. Be advised that the Center has taken action on their concerns
and is working with the Seattle Puget Sound Healthcare System on assisting them with their
healthcare needs.

VA Note:

The VA Puget Sound Health Care System addressed the issue with the following actions:

(a) The staff and administrators at VAPSHCS American Lake Division held several meetings
with the female veterans giving them the opportunity to share their concerns about barriers
to access to medical treatment.

(b) The Mental Health department is offering a trauma recovery therapy group specifically for
the female veterans

(c) The Women’s Clinic brought on a full-time Case Management Social Worker;

(d) The Medical Center filled the Women Veterans Program Manager position to ensure there
is a liaison for female veterans;

(e) The Medical Center's Deputy Director has indicated that they are considering moving the
geographic location of the Women’s Clinic and limiting access to patient’s MH records.

Committee Comment:
Sensitivity training is critical for VHA employees who provide service to veterans; and secondly VA to
hold the VHA Undersecretary, VISN Director, and Medical Center Directors accountable for
improvement in minority outreach programs and services.
VA Note:
The Employee Education System (EES) has three Employee Education Resource Centers (EERCs)
devoted to clinical education efforts. These centers are developing training related to culture care
diversity for health care givers. One example is the series of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder modules
being created for minority veterans groups.
VA is improving its primary outreach vehicle, the Minority Veteran Program Coordinators (MVPCs).
Handbooks, training, position descriptions and ultimately performance measures will be implemented
to improve this critical outreach and liaising arm of the VA.

Ss)

280,"Committee Recommendation #2

Recommend that VISN 20 and the Puget Sound HCS establish a closer liaison and working
relationship with King County to improve veteran's services especially homeless veterans and
veterans in the prison population.

Committee Comment:

Ensure that the MOU between IHS and VA encouraging cooperation and resource sharing is
understood and working. Many of the Indian veterans spoke of IHS clinics on their reservation turning
them away and not being familiar with the MOU between them and VA. Veterans are being bounced
back and forth between two agencies without receiving health care. There were also concerns
regarding the need for VA to pursue changes in rules or statutes to allow veteran cemeteries on
American Indian reservations.

VA Note:

In FY 2004, IHS and VHA instituted a number of governance mechanisms to promote collaboration
and encourage long-term progress in the improvement of services for American Indian/Alaska Native
veterans. A quarterly performance monitor documenting the activities undertaken with IHS and
Tribes by each Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN) was instituted and each Network was
asked to develop an implementation plan for sharing with IHS and Tribal Health providers. VA and
IHS will be providing communication materials describing the Memorandum of Understanding and
how it can be used to advance local collaborations.

Committee Comment:

A perception exists among the Native Americans that the Direct Home Loan Program is ineffective.
VA Note:

VA continues its efforts to develop positive working relationships with Native American groups and
tribes and relevant government entities and provide program information and materials to these
parties and VA personnel. The Department negotiated and entered into a Memorandum of

Understanding (MOU) with five more tribes, to bring the total of participating governments up to 68.
During FY 2003, VA field offices closed 115 loans, for a total of 387 loans made under this pilot
program since its inception. Because of lower interest rates, 88 of these loans were loans to
refinance an existing loan to lower the interest rate.

VA field station staff have held discussions and provided information to representatives of many
different Native American tribes and groups. Prior to VA’s making a loan on tribal trust land, the tribe
must enter into an MOU with VA concerning a number of issues that could arise in administering the
program. Trust lands eligible for this program include both tribally-held trust lands and individually
allotted trust lands. Allotted trust lands fall under the domain of the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA). In accordance with a 1995 MOU between VA and BIA, which outlines the responsibilities of
each agency concerning implementation of this program, VA field personnel continue to work with

BIA Regional Offices to implement this loan program. This includes obtaining BIA approval of

encumbrances on trust land and title plat searches.

Portage Band of Chippewa, the Hoopa Valley Indians, the Jicarilla Apache, the Makah, the
Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, the Muckleshoot, the Northern Cheyenne, the Penobscot, the
Port Gamble S’Klallam, the Resighini Rancheria, the Salish & Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation,
the Seneca, the Skokomish, the Suquamish, the Tohono O’Odham, the Unitah-Ouray Utes, the
Yavapai-Prescott, and the Yselta Del Sur Pueblo.
VA continues to work with representatives of tribes with which it has entered into MOUs to conduct
outreach among veterans within these tribes and Native American groups.
Committee Comment:
The trip to the Yakama Indian Reservation pointed out three critical needs: housing, health care, and
appointments of qualified Native Americans to VA staff.
VA Note:
These issues remain a major challenge for many of our Native American Veterans living on tribal
lands. VA has recognized the need and responded with directed programs such as the VHA/IHS
MOU encouraging collaboration on healthcare services delivery, the Native American Veteran Direct
Loan Program as well as training of Tribal Veteran Representatives (TVRs) in benefits and claims
submission. The department will continue to explore ways to positively impact Native American
Veterans and ensure improved access to VA benefits and services.

282,"New Orleans, Louisiana

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) met in New Orleans, Louisiana on May
4-6, 2004.

The overall impression of the ACMV is that the New Orleans VA Medical Center provides
strong support to homeless veterans in its area of responsibility. In the area of patient advocacy, the
New Orleans VA Medical Center did very well on courtesy, dignity, and respect.

ACMV was very pleased to see that the VISN has implemented programs that exceed VA
standards in providing leadership opportunities to GS-5 to GS-7 employees. VISN 16’s Emerging
Veterans Affairs Leaders Program graduates around 100 employees per year. VISN 16 is to be
commended and it is the recommendation of the ACMV that minority participation in the program be
increased. It is the ACMV’s opinion that New Orleans VBA and VHA are providing outreach to the
community. Market penetration exceeds that of other VISNs and appears to be a result of outreach
efforts.

The ACMV conducted two Town Hall Meetings during this visit. The first meeting was held on
site at the New Orleans VA Medical Center; the second was the American Legion Post in Houma,
Louisiana. From discussions with veterans as well as VA leadership the committee developed
several recommendations which follow.

Committee Recommendation #3
During the ACMV’s visit with Dr. Susan Pendergrass, Deputy Director of VISN 16, she indicated that
there is no reliable data on ethnicity of veterans because information is self-reported. This causes a
problem in that VA does not always know, ethnicity-wise, whom we are serving. We do not believe
this is a fault of VA. Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act has created this situation. Clarification is
needed so that racial and ethnic data can be collected. Disclosure, tracking, and evaluation of
ethnicity—particularly of those being treated at VA facilities—are extremely important and are critical
elements in allowing VA to better understand and serve its minority customers.
Committee Recommendation #4
There is a perception, from the meeting in New Orleans, of unfair ratings of minority veterans
compared to whites. The VA Regional Office is aware of this claim and is looking into the matter.
The committee would like follow-up on this concern.
Committee Comment:
At the Town Hall Meeting in Houma, the majority of veterans in attendance were white (of Cajun
descent) and the primary issue was the opening date of the Houma community-based outpatient
clinic. The ACMV recommends that all future town hall meetings be conducted in towns, not at the
VA. It was the committee’s feeling that veterans are better served if we take our work to their
neighborhoods instead of them coming to us.

8
",0,0,0,0
283,"VA Note:

Town hall meetings are conducted at locations and times that will provide the greatest opportunity for
the target population of veterans to participate. At times this is a location other than a VA facility,
other times the VA facility is the most accessible for the greatest majority of veterans. Every effort to
accommodate the committee's request will be made as long as it provides the maximum access to
the meetings by veterans.

Committee Recommendation #5

At the New Orleans VA Medical Center, a facilities management morale problem was brought up. Mr.
John Church, Medical Center Director, was clearly aware of the issues and was able to address them
in detail. However, several members of the ACMV interpreted the tone of Mr. Church’s responses as
somewhat condescending. | believe it was unintentional. Mr. Church did welcome any investigation
that could evaluate and recommend improvements at the New Orleans VA Medical Center. The
Legislative Staff Panel also brought up issues of discriminations and a hostile work environment. It is
my recommendation that these types of allegations and concerns be turned over to the EO
representative at the appropriate VA office.

Overall, it is the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans perception that the New Orleans VA
Medical Center is providing excellent, quality care to Louisiana veterans, and the leadership from
VISN to the VA Medical Center director to the VA Regional Office is informed and involved. There
are certain issues, as already noted, but these issues do not distract from the overall mission of
caring for the veteran who has “borne the battle.”

Committee Recommendation and VA Responses

The committee had five recommendations. These are delineated below along with VA's
responses.
Recommendation #1:
Strongly advise establishing additional CBOCs throughout Washington State. The impression of the
committee is that veterans in the rural regions of the state are severely underserved.
VA Response:
An additional community based outpatient clinic (CBOC) is scheduled to open in FY06 for Central
Washington. The plan for this CBOC is currently being developed by VAMC Spokane.
Recommendation #2:
Recommend that VISN 20 and the Puget Sound HCS establish a closer liaison and working
relationship with Kings County to improve veteran’s services especially homeless veterans and
veterans in the prison population.
VA Response:
The Secretary approved and directed the Veteran Health Administration (VHA) to implement several
recommendations from the Secretary’s Mental Health Task Force for improving access to mental
health care to homeless and incarcerated veterans. These include implementing a special needs
grant program for homeless chronically mentally ill veterans; requiring that all homeless veterans who
meet clinical eligibility criteria for mental health intensive case management (MHICM) programs be
offered enrollment; all VISNs will develop a plan that addresses the transition needs of incarcerated
veterans; enhancing supported compensated work therapy and employment activities within VA; and
enhancing partnerships with community partners to provided transitional housing.
Incarcerated Veterans:
In 2002, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between VA and the Departments of Justice,
Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and Education concerning the
reentry of adult and juvenile offenders into the community was signed. This program is known as the
Serious and Violent Offenders Reentry Initiative (SVORI).
Since signing the MOU, VA has been a resource partner in the SVORI program. VA has provided
training to all the states and territories concerning VA health care and benefits and participated in two
national conferences on the topic of incarcerated persons’ reentry into the community.
VA is also a partner in a pilot program with the Department of Labor to provide reentry services to
incarcerated veterans. In March of 2004, the Department of Labor, in conjunction with VA, awarded

10
",0,0,0,0
285,"funds to organizations assisting incarcerated veterans’ transition back into the work force. Awards
went to organizations in Los Angeles, CA; Louisville, KY; San Pedro, CA; and Hammond, LA.
Additional funding has been made available to organizations in Roxbury, MA; San Diego, CA; and
Rochester, NY. Agreements have also been made to provide specialized services to incarcerated
veterans in the following states: Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina,
Illinois and Washington.
In June of 2004, the Secretary signed a Decision Memorandum upon the recommendation of his
Mental Health Task Force, that all VISNs address the transitional needs of incarcerated veterans and
that they develop a plan to that effect that will be implemented in FY 2005.
Homeless Veterans
VA offers a wide array of programs specifically designed to help homeless veterans live as self-
sufficiently and independently as possible. In fact, VA is the only Federal agency that provides
substantial hands-on assistance directly to homeless persons. Although limited to veterans and their
dependents, VA's major homeless-specific programs constitute the largest integrated network of
homeless treatment and assistance services in the country.
VA's specialized homeless veterans treatment programs have grown and developed since they were
first authorized in 1987. The programs strive to offer a continuum of services that include:

e aggressive outreach to those veterans living on streets and in shelters who otherwise would

not seek assistance;
e clinical assessment and referral to needed medical treatment for physical and psychiatric
disorders, including substance abuse;

e« long-term sheltered transitional assistance, case management, and rehabilitation;

e employment assistance and linkage with available income supports; and

e supported permanent housing.
Healthcare for Homeless Veterans programs in Washington State exist at VA facilities in Seattle,
Spokane, and Walla Walla. Additionally, VARO Seattle has a Homeless Veteran Coordinator whose
role is to provide information about the services for homeless veterans provided through VHA.
Services include outreach, case management, referrals to benefits counselors, linkage to health care
and housing assistance.
Recommendation #3:
During the ACMV’s visit with Dr. Susan Pendergrass, Deputy Director of VISN 16, she indicated that
there is no reliable data on ethnicity of veterans because information is self-reported. This causes a
problem in that VA does not always know, ethnicity-wise, whom we are serving. We do not believe
this is a fault of VA. Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act has created this situation. Clarification is
needed so that racial and ethnic data can be collected. Disclosure, tracking, and evaluation of
ethnicity—particularly of those being treated at VA facilities—are extremely important and are critical
elements in allowing VA to better understand and serve its minority customers.

11
",0,0,0,0
286,"VA Response:
VA agrees to the importance of the collection of ethnicity and race data. The application form for
Health Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ) has been modified to include queries on gender, race and
ethnicity. Veterans are asked to identify whether they are Spanish, Hispanic or Latino. Applicants
are further asked to identify their racial background specifically: American Indian or Alaskan Native;
White; Asian; Black or African American; and/or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Applicants
may choose all race categories that apply. This new form became available in June 2004 and is in
use throughout the VA system. In an effort to better capture the demographics of our veteran
population accessing healthcare benefits in the future, VA is encouraging veterans to provide VA with
this information through this newly modified form.
Recommendation #4:
There is a perception, from the meeting in New Orleans, of unfair ratings of minority veterans
compared to whites. The VA Regional Office is aware of this claim and is looking into the matter.
VA Response:
The Veterans Benefit Administration is very concerned with fair and equitable treatment of all
veterans. Even the perception of unfair ratings is taken very seriously. The Compensation and
Pension (C&P) Service has contacted station management at the New Orleans Regional Office and
offered assistance in conducting the review. Station management will keep C&P Service apprised of
their findings who, in turn, will advise the committee of their findings at its next scheduled Washington
DC meeting in 2005.
Recommendation #5:
At the New Orleans VA Medical Center, a facilities management morale problem was brought up. Mr.
John Church, Medical Center Director, was clearly aware of the issues and was able to address them
in detail. However, several members of the ACMV interpreted the tone of Mr. Church’s responses as
somewhat condescending. | believe it was unintentional. Mr. Church did welcome any investigation
that could evaluate and recommend improvements at the New Orleans VA Medical Center. The
Legislative Staff Panel also brought up issues of discriminations and a hostile work environment. It is
my recommendation that these types of allegations and concerns be turned over to the EO
representative at the appropriate VA office.
VA Response:
Early in 2003, supervisors, managers, and unions at the VAMC New Orleans identified aggressive
behavior and workplace stress as issues. The decision was made to apply the process and tools
developed by the VA Workplace Stress & Aggression Project of VA’s Office of Occupational Health
and Safety to address these issues. The Office of Resolution Management, who had been funding
the Stress & Aggression Project, also funded and participated in this intervention in New Orleans to
12
",0,0,0,0
287,"develop a way to deal with the high level of EEO complaints at the site, specifically targeting the
facilities management division. By September 2003, a site team set up a “Workplace Aggression
Intervention Training” (WAIT) program at VAMC New Orleans. 120 employees from Facilities
Management and Ambulatory Care were trained. Twelve individuals from the New Orleans staff were
trained as trainers so they could continue to provide this training for the rest of the employees at
VAMC New Orleans. By April 2004, VAMC Director, Mr. Church, designated the Assistant Director,
Fernando Rivera, to lead the New Orleans Project team. This helped to focus the project team and
improve the support of the action teams and the WAIT Trainers. This is supported by the fact that by
the end of FY 2004, 1,026 or 60% of their employees have gone through the WAIT program. This
training was designed to present techniques for improving communication, active listening, and
provide verbal and non-verbal interventions to de-escalate stressful and confrontational interactions.
Training is ongoing.
As a result of the efforts currently in place addressing workplace stress and violence, VAMC New
Orleans’ EEO complaints in Facilities Management service line went from 25 in FY 2003 to 8 in FY
2004. Visits to Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for workplace conflict issues went from 23 in
FY 03 to 0 in FY 04. Based on these results, the Pathology & Laboratory Service Line requested to
participate in the action team project and this has been done.
Summary - tangible progress has been and continues to be made in Facilities Management, as
indicated in the reduction of EEO complaints and EAP visits. The Facilities Management action team
has been working on several interventions to improve the work climate in their service line. They
have improved the “call in” and assignment policies so that there is improved communication between
supervisors and employees. They are developing a business plan for implementing an intervention
dealing with horizontal and vertical respect issues within Facilities Management. There are currently
three action teams working on stress and aggression issues within the New Orleans Medical Center.
The Director's plan is to eventually have a stress & aggression action team established in every
service line. Changing organizational culture is a long term process. Change progresses as a series
of gains and setbacks. It appears that when ACMV conducted their site visit in May of 2004, the long
standing morale problems in Facilities Management were raised, but without discussing the
organizational change efforts that had been underway for some time. Mr. Church and the VAMC
New Orleans leadership (both management and union) are committed to resolving and improving the

Islands

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) advises the
Secretary, through the Center for Minority Veterans, on issues related to the
administration of VA benefits to and for minority veterans; reviews reports and
studies pertaining to minority veterans; and assesses the needs of minority
veterans with respect to health care, rehabilitation, compensation, outreach, and
other benefits and programs administered by VA that are designed to meet such
needs. The Committee executes its responsibilities primarily through site visits,
two of which are conducted each fiscal year.

The ACMV met twice in Fiscal Year 2005. A business meeting was
conducted in Washington, DC, November 30 — December 1, 2004, to prepare the
Committee for its upcoming site visits. The Committee combined its two annual
site visits Into one comprehensive visit when it traveled to Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands February 28 — March 4, 2005. Appendix A contains the
recommendations developed by Committee members based on their
observations of the VA’s healthcare and benefits delivery in Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands. The agenda for this combined site visit is Appendix B.

The Committee had a nomination cycle in January 2005 in which three
new members were added replacing four committee members whose
appointments expired during the month. The Committee currently consists of
twelve members. A complete biographical sketch of current Committee
members is provided in Appendix C.

General Findings

The Advisory Committee previously conducted a site visit to Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands in 1999 and provided the Secretary with a report and
recommendations. A review of that report revealed three recommendations
remain outstanding. Two of the more critical issues are the lack of an Inpatient
PTSD capacity in Puerto Rico and the paucity of outreach to Virgin Islander
veterans by the San Juan Veteran Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Veteran
Affairs Regional Office (VARO) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA).
Also of concern are the continued inadequate condition of the St. Thomas
Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) and the subsequent deterioration of
healthcare services as a result of the inferior facility. The continued
understaffing, especially of support staff, lack of training and inadequate support
for the U.S. Virgin Island healthcare staffs by San Juan VAMC also remain a
major and recurring issue.

There remains a real need for the Puerto Rico based VA leadership to
conduct better outreach and delivery of services to the veterans residing on the

3
",0,0,0,0
301,"U.S. Virgin Islands. Veteran Integrated Service Network (VISN), Memorial
Service Network (MSN) and Regional Area support and expectation that this
outreach occurs is critical to improving the delivery of VA benefits and healthcare
services to U.S. Virgin Islanders.

The Committee continues to have major concerns about VA’s commitment
to providing adequate resourcing of benefit and healthcare services to those
veterans living in the remote and rural areas as exemplified by Puerto Rico and
more specifically the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under funded travel budgets for
patients requiring care for service connected medical conditions; the perception
that a lack of concern exits from local VA leadership for the unique difficulties
remote VA staff face in addition to their daily duties and the added pressures this
remoteness adds to the work environment; and the cultural differences often
prevalent between different minority groups are a recurring motif the Committee
observes in its travels and discussions with minority veterans. This report
addresses concerns specific to the Caribbean veterans but these concerns have
been observed in other rural areas visited by the Committee as well.

On a positive note, while VA struggles to resource the increasing
demands from a growing demand of its services and this causes problems with
access and puts stress on its infrastructure and staff; veterans receiving care and
services indicate that they are satisfied with the service provided. The major
concerns heard by the committee at town hall meetings were not about the
quality of care, but dissatisfaction with access to care and the difficulty in getting
care. Once the veteran accessed the healthcare system or was in contact with
the regional office, they indicated they were very satisfied with VA services and
benefits delivery.

Site Visit Background

The San Juan VA Regional Office calculates its total Puerto Rico veteran
population at 146,001 and its U.S. Virgin Island veteran population at 5,152.
U.S. Virgin Islanders dispute these figures contending that Virgin Island veteran
numbers are closer to 20,000 and are therefore underserved when it comes to
VA healthcare and VA benefits outreach. The lack of consistency in defining the
current veteran population on the U.S. Virgin Islands remains a contentious
issue.

Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are grouped together
organizationally and are attached to the same regional offices within each of the
administrations in VA. Regional delineations are as follows:

Veteran Health Administration (VHA)

Veteran's Integrated Service Network (VISN) 8, VA Sunshine Healthcare

Network, which includes the state of Florida, provides oversight to the San Juan
4
",0,0,0,0
302,"Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) which in turn provides healthcare for
both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Veteran Benefit Administration (VBA)

The San Juan VA Regional Office is part of VBA’s Southern Area which is
comprised of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia,
Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.

National Cemetery Administration (NCA)

The Puerto Rico National Cemetery reports to Memorial Service Network
(MSN) Il which also includes: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana,
Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Regional Economic Status

The economic status of the residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands plays a critical role in their veterans’ propensity for using VA services and
benefits. Census 2000 data as well as information provided by the San Juan VA
Regional Office is used to describe the economic status of the Puerto Rican and
U.S. Virgin Island population. For comparative purposes, the VA defines a low
income veteran as an individual earning less than $36,000 a year.

Household Income

Census 2000 shows that the Puerto Rican median household income is
$14,412 with approximately 81% of households showing an income below
$35,000. The U.S. Virgin Islands median household income is $24,704 with
approximately 63% of households showing an income below $35,000. The
median household income in the United States is $41,994.

Unemployment and Poverty

The population of Puerto Rico is approximately 3.9 million with an
unemployment rate of 10.8%. The per capita income in Puerto Rico is $8,185.
Approximately 45% of Puerto Rican families fall below the poverty level. Census
showed the population of the U.S. Virgin Islands to be 108,612. The per capita
income is higher than Puerto Rico at $13,138; however poverty remains high with
32% of households falling below the poverty level. The unemployment rate in the
U.S. Virgin Islands was last computed at 8.6%. In comparison, the United States
per capita income is $21,557 and the percentage of families falling below poverty
levels is 9.2%. The Census 2000 calculated the unemployment rate for the
United States at 5.8%.

Ss)
",0,0,0,0
303,"The low income levels of the residents of the Islands generate a high
percentage of veterans and beneficiaries eligible for the VA pension program.
Additionally, there is no entitlement to Supplemental Social Security for persons
residing in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Medicare benefits are
limited. While the number of beneficiaries receiving benefits under VA income-
based programs nationwide is approximately 17%, the San Juan VA Regional
Office has 47% of its beneficiaries receiving benefits.

Puerto Rico Site Visit Findings

The “2003 Survey of Veteran Enrollees’ Health and Reliance Upon VA”
report, released by the Office of the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health
for Policy and Planning in December of 2004 showed an 85% increase in the
veteran enrollee population for VA healthcare. Most enrollees were low income.
Additionally, the 2001 National Survey of Veterans conducted by the Department
of Veterans Affairs showed that 19% of Hispanic veterans mentioned no
insurance coverage compared to only 9.6% non-Hispanic veterans. Hispanic
veterans also showed a lower participation rate, in Medicare than non-Hispanic
veterans (23% versus 40%). Hispanic veterans showed lower participation rates
in CHAMPUS/TRICARE and private non - HMOs.

The veterans in Puerto Rico reflect these findings which, in conjunction
with the described income levels, drive high veteran participation for VA services.
Puerto Rican veterans’ high utilization of VA benefits and healthcare services are
in Keeping with survey results on veteran participation rates VA wide. Hispanic
participation for healthcare services is driven by several factors to include:

e High percentage of low income households;

e Paucity of competitive/affordable medical care as described to ACMV by
veterans at town hall meetings;

e Geographic isolation (Puerto Rico from mainland);

e Different time/distance traveling factors on island (though relatively small
distances by U.S. mainland standards, traveling by vehicle in Puerto Rico
is difficult due to extreme congestion on the island’s few roads); and

e High Density population areas drive high CBOC usage.

Problems caused by the high usage of VA facilities by veterans have
different impacts on the three VA facilities. General impact of the above on the
San Juan VAMC as described by veterans to the ACMV during two town hall
meetings includes:

e Overcrowding/over scheduling at the CBOCs and the VAMC;

e Long waiting periods for specialty care;

e Long waiting times invalidate lab results;

e Over use of Emergency Room to by-pass appointment delays;

6
",0,0,0,0
304,"e Capped patient enrollment at CBOCs;

e Veteran dissatisfaction with access.

The above condition should call for VA to reexamine the resources
allocation parameters for Puerto Rico’s VAMC, VARO and NCA budgets.
Specifically VA should re-examine the resource allocation parameters for the
budgets of the Medical Center, Regional Office and National Cemetery in Puerto
Rico. VA needs to specifically review and validate Puerto Rico’s veteran
population projections as well as take into account the unique circumstance
driving the high market share. Additionally, the unique circumstances and
requirements of the U.S. Virgin Islands and the effect on the allocation of
resources to the P.R. V.A. budget must be fully addressed and taken into
consideration when reviewing the budgets for the Puerto Rico VA facilities.
VHA and San Juan VAMC Issues

Specific issues that the Committee strongly feels need to be addressed by
the San Juan VAMC and VHA include:

e A need for additional long term care (LTC) beds in the Spinal Cord Injury
(SCI) unit. Town hall meeting comments by P.R. veterans indicated they
were dissatisfied with the availability of these services and wanted more
beds made available. There was a concern expressed for the potential
influx of Operation lragi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom
(OEF) veterans increasing the demand for spinal cord injury care and the
ability of the San Juan VAMC to meet it.

e There is no long-term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Immersion
program in Puerto Rico. Veterans with severe PTSD must travel to the
U.S. mainland for in-patient treatment, isolating them from family and
support groups and often subjecting them to language and cultural
conflicts. For example, the Vet Center identified three veterans within the
past 6 months who required the Immersion program. However, due to a
lack of an inpatient program the veterans were transferred to the U.S.
mainland for treatment. The current PTSD counseling program only
provides outpatient needs. The Vet Center staff identified this as a major
concern especially with returning OIF/OEF veterans.

e There is a need fora CBOC on Eastern side of Puerto Rico by
(Humacao/Fajardo). A population of 12,965 veterans resides in the area.
A CBOC capable of handling an estimated 4,800 unique patients would
substantially improve healthcare services to veterans in this area. San
Juan VAMC leadership identified the dental clinic at Roosevelt Roads
Naval Air Station as a suitable site.

7
",0,0,0,0
305,"e The Arecibo CBOC has currently stopped enrolling patients because it
has exceeded its patient-physician ratio. It is unable to hire more
physicians due to a hiring freeze. If allowed to hire two more physicians
the CBOC could continue enrollment of up to 4,500 new patients
substantially improving healthcare delivery to veterans in the area.

e There is a demand by veterans and family members for transportation of
elderly/sick veterans to their appointments at the San Juan VAMC from
the various CBOCs around the island.

e The San Juan VAMC is located in a highly-developed metro area and
parking is extremely limited. This causes veterans to either arrive very
early to find parking or to park in prohibited areas where they are ticketed
or towed away. Lack of parking often causes missed appointments and
incurs further delays in rescheduling and forces elderly veterans to
expose themselves to potential injury by walking on public roadways.

e The Veteran's Home has been removed from the priority list for
reconstruction under the Grant Per Diem Program impacting the
availability of long term care for elderly veterans from both Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands. There are no other VA approved Veteran's homes
on Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands.

e Additionally, there is no coordination between the San Juan VAMC and
the Veteran’s Home to address medical care of veterans lodged there,
nor are there any visits by the VAMC’s social workers to the Home to
evaluate the needs of the resident patients.

e Education materials, training courses, veteran claim forms, medical forms
and records as well and conversations with VA personnel need to be
provided and conducted in both English and Spanish. This is critical
since Spanish is the primary language in Puerto Rico and English is the
primary language in the Virgin Islands. Veterans living in the Virgin
Islands complain that their caregivers, documents and instructions are
given in Spanish which they do not understand.

While the Committee noted the challenges facing veterans and healthcare
givers in Puerto Rico, overall it found the quality of healthcare services provided
to be outstanding. In general, the staffs of the VAMC and CBOCs as well as VA
Regional Office staff were highly committed to serving veterans. Special note is
made of the following:

e The Ponce CBOC under the leadership of Dr. Pasalaqua is outstanding;

e Dr. Julia Bonilla, Director of Arecibo CBOC is highly-motivated, caring,
and concerned about her patients;

outstanding knowledge, leadership, and commitment;
e Mr. Jose-Cruz-Roman, Assistance Service Center Manager, San Juan VA
Regional Office is recognized for his dedication and service.
NCA Issues

Other concerns noted by the Committee relate to the Puerto Rico National
Cemetery. The high utilization by Puerto Rican veterans of their burial benefits
and their desire to be buried in the San Juan the National Cemetery is rapidly
exhausting the ability for the facility to meet the burial needs of the Puerto Rican
and U.S. Virgin Island veteran. This is further exacerbated by the relatively short
time NCA has to address these issues before it is unable to accommodate new
burials. Issues facing the Puerto Rico National Cemetery include:

e Existing National Cemetery will cease burial operations in 2008-2010
because of lack of space. A parcel of land amounting to 2,500 acres in
the Sabana Seca Naval Base is available but must be purchased soon; no
funds have been earmarked for purchasing the land. A letter was sent by
the director of the P.R. National Cemetery October 2003 to MSN II
requesting approval to purchase the land. No reply was received
concerning the proposal.

e Numerous general maintenance details, especially in public viewing area,
need to be addressed such as the tattered American Flag, bars around
the viewing stand were rusted, and the Puerto Rican Flag is larger than
the United States Flag. These discrepancies were brought to the attention
of the Cemetery Director.

e $2.3 million for maintenance and renovation to administration and
maintenance buildings, committal shelters and restrooms was authorized
in 1989 but has not been appropriated to the San Juan National
Cemetery. The administration building is in dire need of repair as are the
other support structures.

e The lack of an operational information kiosk allowing veterans families to
easily find their loved ones is a substantive customer service issue for the
San Juan National Cemetery.

U.S. Virgin Islands Site Visit Findings
In addition to the veteran population on Puerto Rico, the Regional Office,
Medical Center, and National Cemetery provide services and benefits to veterans
living in the United States Virgin Islands. The Committee visited St. Thomas and
St. Croix. The veteran population numbers are disputed between the U.S. Virgin
Island government and VA. The numbers range between 5,000 and 20,000
9
",0,0,0,0
307,"veterans. The veteran population in the U.S. Virgin Islands is predominantly
Black, although approximately 15% of Virgin Islanders are Hispanic.
Significantly, the main language of the U.S. Virgin Islands (and the veterans
residing there) is English which results in communication problems with the
Puerto Rico VA facilities whose staff are predominantly Spanish speaking. This
is an ongoing problem for both caregiver and veteran. In addition to these
challenges, specific concerns by each VA administration follow.

VHA and San Juan VAMC Issues

There are two CBOCs on the Virgin Islands, one on St. Croix and one on
St. Thomas. While both serve approximately the same panel of patients, the
differences in the physical condition and amount of space between St. Croix and
St. Thomas are immediately evident. The St. Croix CBOC facility opened in early
2004 and is approximately 4,500 square feet. It meets all Health Insurance
Portability Act (HIPA) requirements and provides adequate privacy for patients
and staff members.

The St. Thomas CBOC’s physical space needs updating to address numerous
concerns:

e Lack of space for patient consultation (is half the size of the St. Croix
CBOC with the same number of patients seen);

e Small pharmacy that provides no privacy to patients because the waiting
room is right next to the service window;

e Waiting area only provides seating for five people and is located right next
to the pharmacy window allowing all to hear instructions given to veteran
patients;

e Space layout does not meet HIPA requirements for privacy;

e Parking is not provided. Patients must compete for parking with persons
with business in the high density cruise ship docking area.

It is the conclusion of the Committee that both CBOCs have similar
problems with regard to outreach and service delivery to veterans eligible for
healthcare benefits. This appears to result in major gaps in service delivery to
U.S. Virgin Island veterans. San Juan VAMC appears to not have the resources
to provide adequate oversight and attention to the unique circumstances facing
its healthcare staff in the two Virgin Island clinics. This results in severe under
servicing of veterans and under-resourced working conditions for the staff.
Specifically:

e CBOCs have low patient enrollment due to zero outreach conducted by
san Juan VAMC. For an identified population of 5,125 veterans, both
CBOCs reported 1,618 uniques with 6,483 visits for 2004. Both
physicians indicate a patient panel of less than 1,200 yet there are over
5,000 identified veterans on the islands.

10
",0,0,0,0
308,"e The lack of assigning homeless coordinators in the Virgin Islands results
in little or no outreach or services for homeless veterans.

e The absence of accurate census/demographics on US Virgin Islands
(USVI) veterans results in potential under servicing of veterans on the
islands.

e A lack of social workers has a severe impact on identifying appropriate
services and methods of delivery for USVI veterans. Several examples of
the staff performing social worker duties include: (1) recently a veteran
died and had no family to help with burial or notification of death. CBOC
staff had to do all the burial benefit applications and attendant tasks; (2)
Staff intervened for a veteran being abused by family members although
not trained for this type of intervention. Immediate action was necessary
to eliminate danger to the veteran. Additionally, staff members often incur
out of pocket expenses when undertaking social worker duties which are
not reimbursed.

e The absence of back up staff for either CBOC results in clinic closure
when either physician is absent.

e San Juan VAMC provides little to no opportunity for annual training for its
Virgin Island health care/vet center personnel, which directly impacts their
ability to meet annual continuing education requirements. When USVI
staffs are included in long distance training, it is conducted in Spanish,
and they are unable to participate.

e There are no patient representatives assigned to address USVI patients’
grievances and concerns. San Juan VAMC has not held any town hall
meetings and has little or no contact with USVI veterans other than
through clinic staff.

e Means-tested geographic subsidy is a major impediment to healthcare
eligibility for USVI veterans. Many veterans claim means testing
underestimates the cost-of-living in the U.S. Virgin Islands and has a
negative impact on non service connected veterans with low incomes but
who are over the threshold for healthcare eligibility.

e Non-use of installed video teleconference equipment in either clinic
compromises delivery of healthcare and health education to U.S. Virgin
Island veterans. The equipment malfunctions, has poor picture quality
and maintenance for the equipment is provided by Bay Pines, Florida.
The San Juan VAMC does not pay for on site maintenance, installation or
assistance when the system Is inoperative. Additionally, little to no

11
",0,0,0,0
309,"scheduling coordination by San Juan VAMC staff of its specialty clinicians
further degrades the functionality of the equipment.

e Female veterans in particular suffer from inadequate delivery of
gynecological healthcare. The Committee observed poor coordination
between San Juan VAMC and gynecological caregivers on the U.S. Virgin
Islands and conclude that female veterans receive inadequate care or
receive care only after taking extra measures such as paying for their own
pap smears and gynecological exams on the U.S. Virgin Islands rather
than waiting for exams in Puerto Rico and incurring the cost of airplane
tickets and lost work hours to get gynecological care that is standard at
mainland VA centers.

e The lack of back up pharmacy staff from the mainland when there are
gaps in coverage result in closed pharmacy operations. (In 2004 the
pharmacy was closed in St. Thomas for almost three months with no relief
identified. )

e The Consolidated Mail Out Pharmacy (CMOP) processes do not take into
account the mail system in the U.S. Virgin Islands which requires all
Incoming mail to be rerouted to Puerto Rico and then redistributed back to
the Islands. This adds approximately two weeks to the delivery of
medication. Pharmacy staffs try to ensure adequate lead time for patient
medications, but when staff is out, medication refills often are not
processed for extended periods.

e The use of fee-basis managed contracts appears to be poorly managed.
This results in the lack of timely payments to fee-basis physicians who
then refuse to treat veterans. This has put an undue burden on the
veterans who have to travel to San Juan for specialized care, even though
this care can be provided in the Virgin Islands.

e San Juan VAMC has negotiated no nursing home or hospice care for
veterans in the Virgin Islands. There are nursing homes on both St.
Thomas and St. Croix, but Committee conversations with staff at these
facilities revealed no contact with San Juan VAMC leadership to develop
potential nursing home or hospice care services for Virgin Island veterans.
Instead, veterans needing such care are sent to Puerto Rico or the U.S.
mainland away from families and support groups. Puerto Rico poses a
major culture issue since Spanish is the predominant language spoken,
and U.S. Virgin Islanders are English speakers.

e There is no Operation lragi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom
(OIF/OEF) Transition Team in the Virgin Islands. The transition team
operates from the San Juan VAMC and works under the assumption that it
reaches OIF/OEF veterans when they return to their units in Puerto Rico.

12
",0,0,0,0
310,"Discussions with veterans in the Islands indicate this is not the case,
resulting in poor outreach and low enrollment of returning OIF/OEF Virgin
Islander veterans.
e Both CBOCs have difficulty getting servicing and maintenance of their
equipment. It was reported to the Committee that San Juan often “forgets”
to add the clinics to their servicing contracts, resulting in no support for the
clinics’ medical equipment. This was recently demonstrated when the
new Mac 2000 EKG (a digital machine that will transfer the patient's EKG
directly onto the electronic chart) were delivered. The Virgin Island
CBOCs were not added to the installation contract. San Juan VAMC
refused to add them to the installation order, requiring instead the CBOC
Staffs to “read the book” and install the complex machines themselves.
The staffs have been unable to comply with this order and the machines
are used aS manual EKG’s which adds substantial administrative time to
the staff diagnosis and filing of results.
e Neither Virgin Island clinic has a government vehicle assigned to assist
with veteran transport or for official travel undertaken by clinic staff.
oan Juan Regional Office Issues

San Juan Regional Office has provided some outreach to the veterans on
the Virgin Islands. One individual visits each island once a month and is given
space in the St. Thomas and St. Croix CBOC. Due in large measure to this
individual’s dedication and initiative, enrollment of Virgin Island veterans has
begun to increase; however the number of veterans (between 5000 and 6000)
requiring outreach and information on VA benefits would indicate the need for a
more permanent solution. In addition to outreach, USVI veterans report having
difficulty with their benefits claims. Specifically:

e No permanent veteran service representative (VSR) is assigned to either
island; veterans must wait for the monthly visit of the individual who
collects their claims. This individual is not a VSR and is unable to
immediately file the claims on behalf of the veterans nor has the technical
knowledge to answer all benefits questions. The claims must be taken to
the San Juan VARO, checked by a VSR there, any missing information
provided by the veteran and then action is taken.

e Veterans complain Compensation and Pension exams/claims processing
follow-up have excessively long timelines due to lack of adequate
assistance with claims at the beginning of the process

e Anecdotal evidence was presented to the Committee that VARO staff has
a low response rate to veterans’ queries for help /explanation of benefits
and claims submission; unfortunately the Committee was not provided

13
",0,0,0,0
311,"telephone or mail logs to analyze and validate the claims by veterans.
The VARO did not appear to have a process is in place to track the claims
of Virgin Island veterans.
e USVI veterans complained of the lack of counseling for benefits programs
such as Vocational Rehabilitation, Home Loan Guaranty, Insurance, and
Education. The San Juan VARO does not break out the USVI veterans
utilizing these programs from the Puerto Rico population which hinders a
true assessment of USVI benefits utilization rates.
e Virgin Island veterans reported that it seems to them that speaking English
is viewed negatively by San Juan staffs that are predominantly Spanish
speaking.
e The veterans reported a lack of concern by VARO/VAMC leaders on how
VA facilities are supported and resourced and, further, that they are
insensitive to the unique circumstances of living in the Virgin Islands.
san Juan National Cemetery

The leadership at the San Juan National Cemetery admitted to not having
visited the U.S. Virgin Islands or providing outreach to the veterans on the
islands. Cemetery staff state that they are prohibited from traveling to the U.S.
Virgin Islands by their leadership. The end result is little to no outreach to
veterans or veterans’ families are currently conducted. Veterans’ families are
unaware of the burial benefits or of the current bereavement counseling
available for those veterans killed on active duty.
There is a need for veterans’ cemeteries on both St. Thomas and St. Croix, both
of which have been pre-approved for application to the State Cemetery Grant
program. However, there is little progress by the U.S. Virgin Island government
in securing the financing required to participate in the program.

312,"APPENDIX A: Committee Recommendations

Although the Committee invites VA to carefully review and address all of
the findings presented earlier in this report (and encourages attention to and
action on these findings at the VISN/Regional Area/MSN level), the following
issues are of priority concern and are submitted as official recommendations.

The Committee acknowledges the unique circumstances Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) pose for the VA. Specifically the remoteness of
the USVI adds to the cost and difficulty of providing VA healthcare services and
benefits. Outreach to veterans residing in these areas is more costly, but at the
same time more critical. The language challenges VA encounters with Puerto

Rico being predominantly Spanish speaking while the Virgin Islanders are

English speaking adds another layer of difficulty requiring extra effort to

communicate between the two groups that are not typically found anywhere else

in the United States. Logistical support for remotely located staffs and the
acquisition and upkeep of facilities, materials and communication is more difficult
and requires strong initiative and an ongoing dialogue and attentiveness to
ensure the remote locations are adequately resourced and able to meet the
needs of its veterans. The following recommendations are meant to address
these unique circumstances and identify those actions the Committee believes
will help the VA in meeting its charter in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin

Islands.

Recommendations specific to Puerto Rico

1. San Juan VAMC should take steps to implement an in-patient PTSD
treatment program in Puerto Rico to address the needs of the current veteran
population as well as the needs of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)
and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).

(Unresolved 1999 concern)
2. VHA provide additional resources to San Juan VAMC for
(a) Increased staffing to support increased veteran population at the
Arecibo CBOC, to include social workers; and
(bo) Resource a new CBOC at Humacao/Fajardo to address the needs of
12,000 plus veteran residing in that area.

3. VA to immediately provide bi-lingual forms and publications in Spanish and
English for all VA facilities in Puerto Rico and that English forms and
publications be provided for veterans residing in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Additionally, Puerto Rico VA staff must conduct conversations in English
when speaking with U.S. Virgin Island Veterans. Generally, VA should
evaluate the need for bilingual publications wherever a substantial Spanish
speaking population exists. Moreover, facilities servicing major Spanish

15
",0,0,0,0
313,"speaking populations should have budget augmentation to help them provide
the necessary forms and publications in Spanish.
(Unresolved 1999 concern)

4. NCA needs to immediately address the needs of the Puerto Rico National
Cemetery by:

(a) Acquiring land for the expansion of the National Cemetery as it is
scheduled to run out of space as early as 2008; and

(b) Provide adequate maintenance funding to help it meet the
requirements for National Shrine status to include but not limited to the
incorporation of a computerized locator kiosk, renovation of the
administrative buildings and the upgrading of burial sites.

Recommendations specific to U.S. Virgin Islands

5. VISN 8 to review San Juan VAMC Fee Basis Management of healthcare
contracts in U.S. Virgin Islands to address recurring payment problems of
local caregivers.

6. San Juan VAMC to improve services to Virgin Island CBOCs by incorporating
the following:

(a) Identify new space for St. Thomas CBOC to bring it up to par with St.
Croix CBOC;

(6) Budget and resource appropriate annual training and travel funds for
USVI clinical staff;

(c) Review FTEE requirements for the USVI clinics and Vet Centers that
address the need for dedicated administrative assistants, social
workers, pharmacy backup, Vet Center backup and medical staff
backup;

(d) Include Virgin Island CBOCs in all maintenance contracts for medical,
Information Technology (IT) and administrative equipment; and

(e) Address recurrent payment problems for Fee Basis caregivers and
specifically, pay for health services in a timely manner.

(f) Conduct extensive outreach to female veterans apprising them of their
healthcare benefits and provided them with reasonable access to
gynecological services on the Virgin Islands.

(g) Immediately incorporate the use of the existing Telehealth equipment
on the U.S. Virgin Islands to provide clinical consults, psychological
consults, Veteran Benefits hearings and consults as well as Diabetes,
Amputee care and elder care training for veterans and their family
members at a minimum. If necessary, budget for equipment upgrade
and maintenance and establish a scheduling mechanism that ensures
the availability of San Juan VAMC medical staff for regular delivery of
healthcare services via the Telehealth equipment.

16
",0,0,0,0
314,"7. San Juan VAMC/VARO/NCA coordinate outreach efforts to veterans on St.
Thomas and St. Croix to ensure “one stop” assistance for veterans on the
islands. This effort must include outreach to:

(a) Inform OIF/OEF veterans and their families on their benefits;

(b) Provide Information on burial benefits/bereavement counseling;

(c) Conduct town hall meetings on at least an annual basis on all the
Virgin Islands;

(d) Identify a Homeless Coordinator for the USVI and have that individual
provide outreach and coordination of services to homeless veterans
(this should not be a collateral duty that would impose more
requirements on an already over burdened staff); and

(e) Initiate outreach to elder veterans and their families to apprise them of
their benefits. (Unresolved 1999 concern)

8. San Juan VAMC address elder veterans’ needs and care on the Virgin
Islands to specifically identify appropriate medical services, per diem beds in
U.S. Virgin Island based nursing homes.

9. San Juan VARO to consider permanently stationing a Veteran Service
Counselor or Representative in the U.S. Virgin Islands to:

(a) Conduct outreach and assist veterans with their benefits claims; and
(b) Track and report separately USVI veterans’ application for Home Loan
applications, Vocational Rehabilitation Training, Compensation and

Pension ratings and Insurance applications.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Committee visited the Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (GLHCS)
April 3-7, 2006. We selected this area due to the diversity of the population and
to assess the outreach and services provided to minority veterans who seek help
at the many Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) facilities located in the area.
Specifically, we looked at adequacy of outreach, volume of veterans reached,
frequency of events held to promote outreach and diversity of staff. The
Committee also visited the Los Angeles National Cemetery and the VA Regional
office. Throughout the report, the Committee makes reference to DVA as the
entity for policy, management and execution. Within that context, we recognize
that the Department has three major administrations, the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the
National Cemetery Administration (NCA).
The Committee was struck by the unusually high homeless rate within the
Greater Los Angeles area and we were pleased with the extensive programs that
have been put in place and seemingly are having an impact in the area. We
recognize that this is not just an issue for the GLHCS however they are
addressing it very aggressively.
During the course of our visit we identified ten recommendations we would like
you to consider addressing. They are not listed by importance rather, each is
equally important as the rest.
Committee Recommendations in brief:
1. Comprehensive Outreach Program
The Secretary mandates that an outreach program be established by all
Veterans Affairs Administrations and appropriate staff offices to reach out and
support all veterans. As a minimum, the program must incorporate the following
goals/activities:
a. Inclusion of and coordination with local, federal and state veterans’
serving organizations in VA facilities’ outreach activities.
b. Establishment of periodic Veteran Town Hall meetings;
c. Allow facilities to advertise veteran benefits and healthcare services and
consult Marketing experts;
d. Expand and improve the use of internet based access to VA benefits
and healthcare, with particular attention given to cultural and linguistic diversity;
3
",0,0,0,0
333,"e. Establish Minority Outreach Coordinators that are full time as
appropriate.

f. Further recommend that these be additional billets that are fully
resourced for those facilities;

g. Mandate enhanced outreach communication and coordination between
VHA, VBA, and NCA;

h. Identify federal grants for states to conduct grassroots outreach
programs.
2. Marketing
DVA should clarify and disseminate its policies pertaining to the issue of
marketing. The Committee observed that field facilities perceive outreach and
marketing to veterans is still prohibited based on a marketing policy established
by VHA in 2002. The Committee views this perception as a serious impediment
to minority veterans’ knowledge of their VA benefits and VA healthcare
entitlements and suggests that VHA clarify its position on the matter to the field.
3. Research Programs
DVA design, develop and fund research agendas focusing on minority veteran
issues. The goal is to inform minority veterans and those entities serving the
minority community of potential barriers to access so that appropriate measures
may be taken to eliminate the barriers.
4. Coordination Care Home Telehealth (CCHT)
DVA aggressively implement the CCHT program in rural communities where
veterans, and especially minority veterans, are at greatest risk of not being able
to receive appropriate and timely VA healthcare (i.e., South Texas, Alaska,
Montana, Samoa, etc.)
5. Vet. Centers
The Committee needs a better understanding of how Vet Centers function and
interact with DVA. We have requested a briefing.
6. Land Use Policies
Greater local flexibility to make business decisions would result in more funds for
ancillary programs such as those that address outreach to minority veterans and
homeless veteran populations.
7. Staff Diversity
Staff diversity at the Los Angeles VA facilities was not representative of the
Minority Veteran population especially with regard to the higher pay grades and
for African Americans, Hispanics and American Indians. This appears to be a
systemic issue throughout DVA.

4
",0,0,0,0
334,"8. Impact of Local Economy on Budget

Facilities’ annual budgets should include adjustments for the cost of living in the
local economy. Proper resourcing of employee payrolls, incentive pay and
retention pay need to reflect the economic realities of the facility location. (i.e. the
cost of housing in Los Angeles makes recruitment of lower pay grade employees
almost impossible and impacts minority hiring because they tend to be in the
lower pay grades.)

9. Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
Veterans

DVA hire Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
minority veterans into the agency to ensure departmental sensitivity to a new
generation of minority veterans seeking services from DVA.

10. Seamless Transition.

With regard to the seamless transition of returning OIF/OEF minority veterans
entering the VA system, the Committee recommends that:

a. DVA establish processes, at the cabinet level, that ensure the
Department of Defense (DOD) and DVA work together on integrating OIF/OEF
minority veterans into the VA healthcare and benefits system;

b. DOD/DVA coordinates their programs informing all minority veterans of
their VA benefits;

c. DVA pursue the collection of DOD data identifying the upcoming
release/discharge of minority service members within 90 days of their release to
assist DVA with outreach to the service member;

d. DVA vigorously pursues DOD’s collaboration, support, and agreement
in sharing minority service member health and service record information.

The Committee looks forward to assisting in advancing the quality of the services
minority veterans currently receive. The findings and recommendations are
explained in much more detail in the body of the report. It is our hope that the
report is read in its entirety.

335,"INTRODUCTION

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans’ (ACMV) responsibilities
includes advising the Secretary and Congress on the administration of VA
benefits and services to and for minority veterans. The Committee conducts site
visits, holds town hall meetings and meets with and VA officials to ensure
accurate and meaningful recommendations are set forth each year in the annual
report that will ensure better services for minority veterans.

The Committee met in Arlington, Virginia December 6 — 8, 2005. VA
senior officials from Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) briefed the
Committee on important issues and programs currently ongoing within the
organization. In addition, the Committee heard from the Veterans Disability
Commission and the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.
The Committee gleaned important information from these briefings that helped
prepare them for future site visits. Appendix (A) of this report contains the follow-
on questions the Committee had for several of the presenters. It also provides
the responses from VA to those follow-on questions.

From April 2 — 8, 2006, the Committee conducted a site visit to the Greater
Los Angeles Health Care System (GLAHCS), Veterans Affairs (VA) Long Beach
Health Care System, Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Center, the Los Angeles
Regional Office and the Los Angeles National Cemetery. While one of the
primary purposes was to look at outreach efforts extended to minority veterans in
light of cultural sensitivity and frequency, the Committee was exposed to issues
that affect all veterans. Appendices (B) and (C) are the respective agendas for
the Committee’s Washington DC meeting and Los Angeles site visit.

The Committee’s visit to the Los Angeles Ambulatory Care Center left an
indelible mark on the members, because of the staggering number of homeless
veterans. It was reported that the veterans’ homeless population was
approximately twenty-three percent (21,400) of the total 90,000 homeless
population in Los Angeles. Although several programs had been established to
minimize the plight of all homeless veterans, the Committee was concerned that
those programs might not be of sufficient magnitude to effectuate noticeable and
effective changes in the minority veteran homeless community. We believe that
similar situations may affect the homeless veteran population throughout the
Continental United States and its Territories.

We believe that much remains to be accomplished for all veterans and,
particularly, minority veterans. We applaud the efforts and the programs to
support, identify, and care for soldiers, sailors and airmen, who have served in
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) theaters
of operations. The early identification of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
will certainly help in the observation and treatment of all veterans who served in

6
",0,0,0,0
336,"those areas. Yet, we are concerned that the same services might not be readily
available to minority veterans who have served in the Vietnam Conflict.

Further, the Committee understands that while the focus is on minority
veterans’ issues, it is important to take note of all veterans’ issues as they
present themselves in the course of the Committee’s work. It is with this in mind
that we present our twelfth annual report.

Throughout the report, the Committee makes reference to the Department
of Veterans Affairs (DVA) as the entity for policy, management, execution. The
Committee recognizes the DVA has three major administrations:

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)

Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)

National Cemetery Administration (NCA)

The Committee’s recommendations are delineated in Appendix (D).
Committee members’ biographies are in Appendix (E).

Monday, April 3, 2006

Greater Los Angeles Health Care System (GLAHCS)

The Committee gathered the following from the Executive Brief:

1. A special outreach program has been developed for currently returning
OIF/OEF veterans to provide a timely, seamless transition experience
from Department of Defense (DOD) to the Department of Veterans Affairs
(DVA). However, there did not appear to be adequate resources
(personnel and dollars) for effective outreach to existing veterans given
the size of the population being served. Outreach to Native Americans, in
particular, was found to be minimal.

a. There was no Native American outreach coordinator assigned. The
Committee noted that direction had been provided recently to
establish a Minority Veterans Outreach program, but the program
was not yet staffed. It appeared that primary responsibility rested
on one collateral duty person, who had been assisted on a part-
time basis for the past six months.

b. The homeless grant and per diem program was funded separately
by the DVA. However, Congressional authority for the program is
soon to expire. The Committee strongly urges its re-authorization.

2. The Los Angeles area has the largest homeless population (approximately
90,000) in the nation. It was estimated that approximately twenty-three
percent, or 21,400 of the homeless population, were veterans. The
committee recognized the impact of poor public transportation system;
high cost of living that presented a challenge for recruitment of healthcare
professionals; and an aging infrastructure.

3. Staff diversity appeared to be representative of the community; however,
African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans were under-
represented in the higher grade levels. This observation appears to be
systemic throughout the Department. In its December meeting, the
Committee made the same observations at the DVA and asked for
processes to correct that issue.

4. The Committee noted that a special program — Coordination Care Home
Telehealth (CCHT) — had been implemented within the GLAHCS. This
special initiative was designed to provide continuous monitoring, frequent
communication, early detection & intervention of patients at a cost of

8
",0,0,0,0
338,"$1,000 per patient. DVA and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
should include the program at all its facilities.

5. GLA appeared to be under-funded. Patient population seemed to be the
“only” criteria for funding. In itself, patient growth may be an inadequate
measure of the costs of operating the facilities, which are by nature
complex. The Committee was also advised that the majority of the VA
$2.5 billion supplemental has not reached the field; it appeared that 60%
of the supplemental was being retained at DVA/VHA, in Washington. The
Committee observes that DVA should establish processes to ensure that
resourcing of facilities consider their location, such as high cost of living
areas, and their ability to maximize staff recruitment and retention in those
areas. Finally, DVA/VHA should ensure that funds are distributed to
facilities based upon requirements and needs; should obtain additional
resources for VAROs, specifically for appellate work; and ensure that
resourcing models consider the relationship between staffing and
workload.

6. Arelated funding issue was the low percentage of income (2%) derived
from the oil well on the property that is allocated to the GLA budget. The
Committee understood that this percentage was allocated by VA as the
owner of the property and the adequacy of the distribution should be
reviewed.

7. DVA centralization of the IT functions in Washington, DC, had effectively
caused a self-imposed buying freeze for medical equipment for fear of
violating IT buying restrictions. Furthermore, this policy was seen as
detrimental to a much decentralized IT system.

There is a need to review the adverse impact that current IT policy is
having on facilities and organizations, specifically where it concerns
needed equipment purchases. For example, the Committee was
advised that needed medical equipment could not be purchased,
because of restrictions imposed by the current IT policy. The
Committee was concerned that the impact of such a policy would
affect the care given not only to Minority population, but also to all
beneficiaries. The policy needs to be reviewed and modified as
necessary.

8. The CARES process, which was intended to determine and maximize
efficient land use, had not yielded a plan to generate adequate revenues.
A better and speedier land use plan is needed, along with the latitude to
begin taking some actions in the near term. The Committee was advised
that the property could not be used for the benefit of veterans, such as for
expansion of housing for staff, and other uses of vacant land. There
seemed to be a need to take advantage of this property, which has an

9
",0,0,0,0
339,"estimated value of $6 billion. The Committee observed that the inability of
GLAHCS to exercise its land use options in a timely manner indirectly
impacted the availability of VA healthcare services for veterans.

9. The Committee noted several standout GLAHCS programs to include:
Seamless Transition Outreach and Retention (STOR) program;
Coordination Care Home Telehealth (CCHT); New Directions (recipient of
Homeless Grant and Per Diem Program); as well as general outreach to
the homeless veteran population; which it considered to be models for
DVA.

Tuesday, April 4, 2006
Los Angeles VA Regional Office (VARQO)

1. The transformation of the Los Angeles Regional Office, from one of
skepticism towards veterans and a high rate of denial of benefits to one of
customer focus and customer satisfaction with claim approval percentages
compatible with the rest of the nation, was noteworthy. The change of
direction provided by new leadership has resulted in a highly-motivated,
well-focused work force that enjoys high morale, coupled with the approval
of the veterans that they serve. The Committee commends all personnel
associated with that transformation. It is a model which should be
replicated throughout DVA.

2. The Committee toured the entire facility and was struck with the level of
pictorials, and other memorabilia that graced all floors and offices within
the Regional Office. Discussion with Veterans, who were visiting the
facilities, showed extreme satisfaction with the surroundings. Of note,
were the Veterans’ praise for the courtesy and care exhibited by all with
whom contacts were made. The Committee congratulates all personnel at
the Regional Office.

3. The Committee noted that the LA VARO had a significant backlog in their
appellate reviews. It was reported that 4,000 appeals were pending,
which represented approximately 23% of workload; yet only 8% of the
VARO staffing was designated to work on those appeals. The Committee
was concerned that DVA’s resource allocation model did not account for
this additional workload.

4. The Committee met with the following California Veteran Service
Organization officers:

Dan Ortiz, National Service Supervisor, Veterans of Foreign Wars
Bill McClure, Director, California Department of Veterans Affairs

Dan Contreras, Junior Vice-Commander (Los Angeles), Disabled

American Veterans

Earl lvey, National Service Officer, National Blinded Veterans

Association

Susan Alvarado, Paralyzed Veterans Association

Of note were the following points addressed by the officers:

a. Medical facilities in the L.A. area were not adequately prepared to
provide services to women veterans.

b. Veterans complained about the difficulty of obtaining transportation
to and from facilities, particularly for the blind and other disabled
veterans.

c. The greater L.A. area had all the significant factors that impacted
on the delivery of services, and many veterans were unaware of the
benefits because of the cultural diversity within the community.
Many of the communities were isolated linguistically. This required
targeted outreach which needs additional assets. This also
identified a need for increased funding for outreach. The
Committee noted the existence of an excellent program to reach the
Korean community, relying on newspapers and television media
which could serve as a model for other DVA agencies targeting
specific veteran populations.

d. California Department of Veterans Affairs can be most effective at
implementing and supporting grassroots outreach programs.
Concurrently, the various associations of Veterans Service
Organizations should be incorporated in all programs. The
Committee supports the recommendations of providing, and/or
facilitating access to, federal grants to the states for grassroots
outreach programs. The Committee also supports a much closer
association between all DVA agencies and Veterans Organizations.
In fact, the Committee was struck by the lack of coordination,
information, and support between DVA organizations and the
associations of Veterans Organizations. The Committee suggests
that a more coordinated and concentrated effort be established, and
that monthly meetings between those elements be conducted.

LA Ambulatory Care Center
1. The ambulatory facilities were relatively new. The staff was extremely
dedicated. Its outreach programs for homeless and incarcerated veterans
were exemplary and innovative. These programs have resulted in
1]
",0,0,0,0
341,"significant decreases in recidivism and should be used as models for other
similar areas. Yet, the Committee was concerned because of the absence
of detailed racial and ethnic profiles for the categories of veterans served.
Also, as the Committee noted here as well as at other locations, the
absence of information on Native American veterans was quite
disconcerting. DVA needs to remedy the lack of ethnic information as
soon as possible. This Committee has been in existence for several years
and has noted this issue on many occasions. Leadership must be
exercised to bring all DVA agencies in line and to direct the compilation of
ethnic data for all population, which falls under the aegis of the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans. Efforts should be made to obtain ethnic
data from all federal agencies, such as DOD and those agencies dealing
with Native Americans.

2. The Committee was informed that the majority of incarcerated veterans
were not prone to violence, except domestic violence. This suggested that
the staff was “safe” in pursuing contacts with those veterans. Yet, this also
suggests that DVA staff providing care to this category of violent offender
needs to recognize that domestic violence is as equally serious as other
inter-personal violence.

Veterans’ Town Hall Meeting

1. Approximately twenty-two (22) Veterans attended the town hall meeting,
which was unremarkable in content.

2. The disappointing attendance raised the question of the adequacy of
communications among and interaction between the GLAHCS and the
Veterans Organizations in the Los Angeles area. The Committee also
noted the conspicuous absence of all senior DVA staff representatives,
within the Los Angeles area, and of the Veterans Service organizations.
This suggested that interaction and communication among all agencies
interested in Veterans’ support and service were conspicuously non-
existent.

3. A Female non-veteran relayed the concern that Filipino citizens who
served during WWII are not granted veteran status and requested that this
be rectified. The Committee researched the background on the issue and
found the following:

a. In 1941, under President Roosevelt, the Commonwealth Army of
the Philippines was called into service for the United States. Many
Filipinos who served at that time were killed or wounded in combat.
Those who did serve were supposed to receive full veterans’
benefits by reason of their active service with the U.S. armed
forces. In 1946, Congress enacted the Rescission Act of 1946,

12
",0,0,0,0
342,"which deemed that the service performed by these Filipino veterans
would not be recognized as “active service’ for the purpose of any
U.S. law conferring “rights, privileges, or benefits.” This included
the denial of veterans’ access to health care and pension benefits
and limited their death compensation to half of their American
counterparts. Approximately 30,000 of 200,000 Filipino WWII
veterans are still alive, of whom 7,000 live in the United States.

b. H.R. 4574, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2006, and a similar
Senate Bill, S-146 would deem certain military service performed
by Filipino veterans’ active military service for purposes of eligibility
for veterans’ benefits and services through the VA, and repeal
certain provisions that disqualify such service. It was the
enactment of these proposed bills that the Committee was asked to
support.

c. The Committee believes that these minority veterans’ service
should be afforded “active service” for purposes of benefits under
the VA, and therefore, the Committee supports enactment of the
legislation.

Los Angeles National Cemetery (LANC)

1. The Committee visited the L.A. National Cemetery and was impressed
with the dedication and initiative of the small staff to honor veterans and
provide support to their families. $25.5 million were programmed for
improvements. The cemetery is now closed for casketed burials for lack
of room and needs additional land for expansion. Negotiations were
underway with the director of the GLAHCS for the use of twenty acres of
land that would provide 80,000 niches for the columbarium, which would
last approximately 12 years.

2. The Committee was concerned about the position classification and
promotion potential for Ms. Jones. Ms. Jones has held the Grade of GS-
05 for the past ten (10) years. Also of note was that Ms. Jones has been
the Assistant Director for LANC for the past ten (10) years, as a GS-05.

3. The Committee was informed that the family of Bob Hope has offered
$500,000 for the historically correct restoration of the chapel on the
grounds. A draft memorandum of understanding has been two years in
the making and is at the VA General Counsel's office. That memorandum
needs to be expedited.

1. The Committee was briefed on the experiences of a returning war veteran
who served as an Army engineer in Iraq. The individual's experiences
illustrated an unintended gap in providing needed healthcare services in
the transition between DOD and VA. The veteran in question returned
from Iraq in November 2003 and was on terminal leave from January 2004
through March 2004. He sought help from the VA healthcare system with
two weeks remaining in his terminal leave period and was turned away
because he was considered to be in DOD’s care program. The veteran
returned for treatment at the end of the terminal leave period and it took
six weeks to begin treatment for PTSD and other physical ailments. The
experiences of this veteran were shared by other veterans who testified
before the Committee and highlighted policy matters that must be resolved
In order to achieve the intended seamless transition for returning war
veterans.

2. “Improving Healthcare for Minority Veterans,” Dr. Harada, PhD

a. The Committee received a brief of an ongoing study, “Racial/Ethnic
Variations in Veterans Healthcare Access and Quality” which
identified the principal reasons for non-use of VA Healthcare
facilities by men and women veterans. Interestingly, the reasons
were different for men and women. For men, the principal reason
for non-use of VA facilities was a perception of poor interpersonal
communication between the veteran and the attending medical
staff. The negative perception was interpreted as poor quality care
and resulted in dissatisfaction with the VA. For female veterans,
only 8% used VA facilities, with the principal reason for non-use
being lack of knowledge about eligibility criteria and available
benefits. This also resulted in a perception of low quality care. The
studies indicated that the use or non-use of VA facilities was less
race dependent than in the private sector.

b. The studies did not address the participation of Native American
veterans in the VA healthcare system.

3. The Committee was also briefed on VA & Indian Health Services, “Access
for American Indian & Alaska Native Indians.” The study was limited in its
scope by a representation of only 44% of Native American veterans. This
ongoing study disclosed that 28% of the represented veterans use VA
healthcare facilities when no Indian Health Service (HIS) hospital or clinic
was available; 47% of Native American veterans used only IHS facilities
when an IHS hospital was available; and 25% were dual users, accessing
VA facilities for diagnostics and specialty care and using IHS mainly for
primary care and chronic diseases. These statistics highlighted the need

14
",0,0,0,0

benefits that they are not using. There was a significant need to promote
accessibility to VA facilities and services. Throughout the visit, the
Committee was informed that “marketing VA services were prohibited and,
as a result, there were impediments in advising eligible beneficiaries of the
services available. DVA should consider defining “marketing” for the
purposes of informing its eligible population of their entitlements. The
Committee was concerned that the narrow interpretation of “marketing”
was being used for purposes which did not seem to be supportive of the
VA mission.

Long Beach Health Care System, Veterans Integrated Support Network

(VISN) 22

1. The Committee was briefed on overall operations of VISN 22 with
particular emphasis on minority affairs. Each facility had a minority
coordinator; however, it was determined that Minority Coordination were
collateral duty assignments. The Director indicated “tremendous effort” for
Native American outreach; however, success was not forthcoming.

2. There were no Native Americans on the VISN director’s immediate staff.
Further, there was incomplete or no data on race, ethnic group distribution
of the patient load. It was reported that 40% of the veterans do not self-
report race or ethnic information making the measurement of progress in
servicing minority veterans difficult to achieve.

3. Recommendations and suggestions were provided the Network Director
on means and processes for improvement. The Director's response is
appended to this report. The Committee believes that the planned action,
when taken, will go a long way to enhancing outreach to minority groups
and to measuring progress in their treatment.

Long Beach Healthcare System (LBHCS)

1. The Director of the Long Beach HCS highlighted four new mental health
programs for PTSD, dual-diagnosed individuals, sexual trauma, and a
drop-in center for severely mental-ill veterans.

2. Of significance was Long Beach's strong outreach program for
incarcerated veterans. The program’s approach centered on developing
with the Veterans a working relationship, which would help them cope (or
integrate) with society after their release; working with the public
defenders and the homeless court to get released veterans transferred
into the VA system for treatment. There were no metrics to measure the

15
",0,0,0,0
345,"level of achievement with the program; but all personnel associated with
or involved in the program expressed confidence that the desired results
were being achieved.

3. In the area of minority outreach, the Committee noted that there were no
African American representatives on the Minority Council. Many activities
were listed under the heading of outreach, but there were no metrics to
measure success, and racial/ethnic data were incomplete. There were no
Town hall meetings with veterans; but periodic forums were held with
different groups to provide information about the services available. The
prevalent belief among the director’s staff was that VA was precluded from
advertising its services. This belief significantly restricted outreach efforts.
Although the Committee was informed that the prohibition against
outreach has been rescinded, there was a need to define “marketing” as
suggested during our visit at GLAHCS. The Committee noted the
apparent absence of coordinated effort with state or county agencies and
with service organizations to leverage outreach efforts to minority groups.
As previously suggested, all activities should maintain close coordination
and cooperation with state and county agencies, and with service
organizations to maximize efforts to reach eligible beneficiaries.

Villages of Cabrillo
The Committee visited the Villages of Cabrillo and found a unique collaboration
between for- profit and non-profit organizations.

1. The Villages of Cabrillo is located on former U.S. Navy land in Long
Beach. This unique organization services approximately 1800 veterans
per year. Its main focus is to outreach homeless veterans through
treatment, training, assistance in securing jobs, and independent living. A
twenty person contingent from the VA collaborates in the Cabrillo
operation in providing a full range of interventions. This type of
arrangement was noteworthy and should be considered for emulation in
other large urban areas throughout the country. Assistance in providing
funding to the Villages of Cabrillo should be an issue for DVA. Eleven (11)
Veterans, in different stages of intervention and treatment at Cabrillo,
discussed the program with the Committee. All, without exception,
expressed their total and unequivocal praise for the staff and the programs
offered at the Villages of Cabrillo.

2. The Committee was impressed by the participation and involvement of
Native Americans in the program. Yet, as suggested previously, there
was a need to reach out to Native Americans.

3. During the tour of the Villages, the Committee noted its exceptionally fine
condition. All personnel exhibited great pride in the Village.

The Committee concluded its activities by holding the second Town Hall Meeting
with Veterans. The meeting was advertised on a billboard, located at the
entrance of the installation. Coordination and communication with Veterans
Organizations seemed to have been minimal. Eleven persons, other than staff,
attended the meeting.

1. Anon-veteran — A Navajo Indian serving the Native American community
made a passionate plea to develop greater cultural sensitivity among
healthcare workers within the VA system, so that Native American
veterans would find it more attractive to visit VA facilities for treatment.
The Committee endorsed such a recommendation and recommends that
DVA considers establishing cultural sensitivity training for all its personnel,
located in and around areas with high density of Minority Veterans. The
Committee recognizes that such a program may be taxing in terms of cost;
yet, the benefits derived would outweigh cost.

2. The daughter of a veteran, who was a former green beret and resided in
New Mexico, pointed out that there were no VA medical facilities in and
around the rural area where her father lives. Local outpatient clinics did
not have all the facilities and services his medical condition required. She
made a passionate plea for more VA facilities and/or clinics in rural areas
in New Mexico. During previous visits and in discussions with Veterans
from other parts of the country, there were similar cases and pleas for VA
facilities in rural areas.

19
",0,0,0,1
349,"PART III RECOMMENDATIONS
The Committee recommends the following:
1. Outreach Program

The Secretary mandates that an outreach program be established by all
Veterans Affairs Administrations and appropriate staff offices to reach out and
support all veterans. As a minimum, the program must incorporate the following
goals/activities:

a. Inclusion of and coordination with local, federal and state veteran
serving organizations in VA facilities’ outreach activities. These
entities should include, as a minimum, state and county Veterans
Affairs Agencies, Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), veteran
serving organizations (i.e. minority veterans’ organizations that have
not been granted VSO status), agencies and organizations that serve
the minority community in the local area, faith-based organizations that
serve veterans, etc.;

b. Establishment of periodic Veteran Town Hall meetings with veterans
and their families to determine needs and issues; meetings/processes
must ensure that minority veterans and communities are targeted in
culturally appropriate venues;

c. Allow facilities to advertise veteran benefits and healthcare services
and consult Marketing experts to help VA facilities conduct effective
communication of VA offerings with particular attention to marketing to
minority communities;

d. Expand and improve the use of internet based access to VA benefits
and healthcare, with particular attention given to cultural and linguistic
diversity;

e. Establish Minority Outreach Coordinators that are full time, where
warranted. Further recommend that these be additional billets that are
fully resourced for those facilities, rather than requiring facility directors
to give up other billets to fill those positions;

f. Mandate enhanced outreach communication and coordination between
VHA, VBA, NCA and appropriate staff offices;

g. Identify federal grants for states to conduct grassroots outreach
programs.

2. Marketing
A current ban on marketing established by an Assistant Secretary of VHA
was brought to the attention of the Committee several times during its site visit.
This policy is currently interpreted by the field as a ban on all outreach programs
especially to minority veteran populations. The Committee views the application
of this policy as a serious impediment to minority veterans’ knowledge of their VA
20
",0,0,0,0
350,"benefits and VA healthcare entitlements. The repeal or redefining of the DVA
policy prohibiting marketing needs to be immediately disseminated to all DVA
field facilities. The Committee was led to believe that the memorandum
establishing the ban on marketing had been formally rescinded. If this is correct,
it is vital that all facilities be advised that outreach to minority veteran populations
is encouraged and expected. The Committee desires a brief on the efforts taken
by DVA leadership addressing this contentious issue at its next Washington DC
Committee meeting.

3. Research Programs

DVA design, develop and fund research agendas focusing on minority
veteran issues to include but not limited to:

a. Identification of racial-ethnic health disparities;

b. Identification of barriers that prevent minority veterans from accessing

and using their veteran benefits and healthcare services;

c. Identification of what culturally appropriate practices would support

greater participation in VA benefits and services by minority veterans;

VA must endeavor to coordinate and disseminate the results of such
research to audiences both within DVA (practicing healthcare givers, VBA and
NCA employees) as well as providing briefings of findings to VSOs, minority
community leaders, state and county veteran’s officers, etc. The goal is to inform
minority veterans and those entities serving the minority community of potential
barriers to access so that appropriate measures may be taken to eliminate the
barriers.

4. Coordination Care Home Telehealth (CCHT)

VA aggressively implements the CCHT program in rural communities
where veterans, and especially minority veterans, are at greatest risk of not being
able to receive appropriate and timely VA healthcare (i.e., South Texas, Alaska,
Montana, Samoa, etc.) The Committee noted in particular the Coordination Care
Home Telehealth (CCHT) program in Los Angeles that would have broad
implications for minority veteran health if aggressively utilized throughout the
country.

5. Veteran Centers

A comprehensive briefing on Rehabilitation Counseling Services be given
the Committee at its next Committee meeting in Washington DC. The purpose is
to fully explain the functions of the Veterans Centers and their interaction with
DVA’s health facilities, concerning minority veterans.

21
",0,0,0,0
351,"6. Land Use Policies

VA should conduct a review of land use policies within the agency, to
allow VA facility Directors greater latitude in generating revenue to execute their
mission. Greater local flexibility to make business decisions would result in more
funds for ancillary programs such as those that address outreach to minority
veterans and homeless veteran populations. Because of the impact of CARES
on this issue, the Committee requests an update on CARES at it next
Washington DC meeting.
7. Staff Diversity

Staff diversity at the Los Angeles VA facilities was not representative of
the Minority Veteran population especially with regard to the higher pay grades
and for African Americans, Hispanics and American Indians. This appears to be
a systemic issue throughout the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). The
Committee recommends that DVA:

a. Develop a targeted recruitment plan for minority hiring at all levels of
the department across the country;

b. DVA design, implement and fully resource cultural sensitivity training
programs for all DVA employees and make it mandatory;

c. DVA direct the compilation of ethnic/racial data of its employee
population and the veteran population in all its data gathering
processes;

d. Provide a brief at the Committee’s next Washington DC meeting on the
progress made concerning this issue.

8. Impact of Local Economy on Budget

In formulating its budget for facilities, there must consideration of the local
economy and its impact. Facilities’ annual budgets should include adjustments
for the cost of living in the local economy. Proper resourcing of employee
payrolls, incentive pay and retention pay need to reflect the economic realities of
the facility location. (i.e. the cost of housing in Los Angeles makes recruitment of
lower pay grade employees almost impossible and impacts minority hiring
because they tend to be in the lower pay grades.)

As a minimum the Committee recommends:

a. DVA establish processes to insure that resourcing of facility budgets
consider their location, cost of living, and recruitment/retention cost
requirements;

b. Ensure that funds are distributed to facilities based upon requirements
and needs;

22
",0,0,0,0
352,"c. With respect to Regional Offices, provide additional staff and funding
for appellate work to ensure VARO budgets are based on staff to
workload ratios.

9. Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
Veterans

DVA hire Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom
(OEF) minority veterans into the agency to ensure departmental sensitivity to a
new generation of minority veterans seeking services from DVA. The Committee
recommends DVA review its pilot recruitment program “Coming Home to Work”
to ensure it adequately targets OIF/OEF minority veterans for employment
throughout the Department.
10.Seamless Transition

With regard to the seamless transition of returning OIF/OEF minority
veterans entering the VA system, the Committee recommends that:

a. DVA establish processes, at the cabinet level, that ensure DOD and

DVA work together on integrating OIF/OEF minority veterans into the
VA healthcare and benefits system;

b. DOD/DVA coordinate their programs informing all minority veterans of
their VA benefits;

c. DVA pursue the collection of DOD data identifying the upcoming
release/discharge of minority service members within 90 days of their
release to assist DVA with outreach to the service member;

d. DVA vigorously pursue DOD's collaboration, support, and agreement
in sharing minority service member health and service record
information.

The following relates to the Direct Home Loan Program which was briefed
to the Committee at its December 6-8, 2005 Washington DC meeting.
11. Native American Veteran Direct Loan Program

Under the authorizing legislation of the Native American Veteran Direct
Loan Program, VA is to receive $.05 (sic) million each year for administration and
outreach activities, including travel to meet with tribes and individuals.

a. What plans are currently in place by VBA to utilize these funds to

increase outreach efforts to Native communities?

Also in the program's authorizing legislation, it states that VA, among
other things, is to attend housing conferences, and provide information to
veterans, tribal governments and organization (sic). Other program requirements

23
",0,0,0,0
353,"state that VA should annually assess and report to the Congress on the
effectiveness of its outreach activities and annually report on the pool of eligible
Native American veterans.

b. Are the current figures reflecting the activity of the program over

the last thirteen years being reported to Congress annually?

The Committee requests a follow-up briefing from VBA to address the

concerns delineated above.

354,"Appendix A: Responses to Committee Follow-on Question from
its December 2005 Washington DC Meeting

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
Question 1: Why isn’t veterans’ high utilization rates in certain areas used
as a factor in determining appropriate budgeting and resources? (e.g.,
Puerto Rico)
Response:
Utilization rates are used as a factor in determining appropriate budget and
resource. The amount of funding a network receives is based on the number
and type of patients served. The network then determines how to allocate
budget and resources to its facilities.
Question 2: Why can’t VHA consider contracting health care services from
IHS to provide care for veterans living in rural and remote areas (e.g.,
Alaska) and provide reimbursement for patient travel to/from health care
facilities?
Response:
Under the Economy Act, Federal agencies have authority to purchase goods or
services from other Federal agencies, subject to limitations prescribed in law and
regulation. Those limitations include the stipulation that the arrangement be in
the best interest of the United States government, that the services can not be
acquired more easily or more economically in the private sector, that the agency
supplying the services can readily meet the request and that the agreement does
not conflict with other agency authorities.
Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human
Services, VHA and the Indian Health Service (IH) agreed to work together to
“Improve beneficiary's access to quality health care and services.” Toward this
end, VHA and IHS field staff have been encouraged to explore all available
options under their authorities for delivery of services that meet the local needs
and requirements of both agencies. In a number of locations, IHS and the tribes
have agreed to provide space where VHA can deliver services to beneficiaries.
(It is important to note that tribal leaders exercise the legal authority to determine
who can have access to health services on tribal lands, whether delivered by IHS
or the tribe, and must pro-actively approve use of facilities by non-tribal
members.) At this time, only the Choctaw Nation Tribal Health Authority has
determined that providing services to all veterans through a VHA-contracted
community-based outpatient clinic is in the interest of the tribe, although a
number of other tribes are considering similar arrangements.

25
",0,0,0,0
355,"Question 3: What specific programs is VHA fielding to ensure diversity on
their staff?
Response:
VHA’s 2006-2010 Workforce Succession Strategic Plan provides information on
training programs that were implemented at the field and national level to provide
opportunities for all employees. These programs assist with the development of
leadership skills or skills in various major occupations that are difficult to recruit
or retain. Field facilities have various training programs (i.e. leadership
effectiveness accountability development (LEAD), Upward Mobility Programs,
and National Nursing Educational Initiative), that addresses the development of
employees at all levels. The Executive Career Field Candidate Development
Program and the Technical Career Field program are two national programs that
address components of leadership and technical skills needs. Officials are
sensitive to diversity concerns during the recruitment and selection processes.
The Executive Career Field Candidate Development Program (ECFCDP) was
established in 2002 and provides developmental opportunities for high-potential
employees, preparing them to apply for Executive vacancies. ECFCDP is a two-
year program which consists of a personal development planning (PDP) and
mentor and preceptor components as well as a wide variety of educational and
experiential learning opportunities. Candidates attend an assessment center and
learning goals are tailored to meet the identified needs of the individual.
In the Executive Career Field Program minorities are selected at a higher rate
(24.68%) than their presence in the applicant pool (22.70%). The workforce
distribution of the applicant and candidate pools is continuously monitored in an
effort to improve the workforce distribution at the executive levels as compared to
the relevant civilian labor force.
The Technical Career Field internship program was created to develop
employees in fields where full-time training in VHA procedures and regulations Is
required, such as Prosthetics Representative, Human Resource Specialist,
Budget Analyst, etc. Two-year internships are centrally funded. Recruitment is
focused on local colleges and universities. Each intern is placed ata VHA
facility and trained by a Preceptor experienced in the target position. Preceptors
receive training, interns convene for an annual conference with their peers, and
the program is evaluated at the national level. The program is designed to flex
with changing workforce needs. On an annual basis, the target positions and
number of intern slots are determined based on current and projected workforce
needs and program evaluation data.
Technical Career Field has a national percentile of 22.37% of minority
representation. The workforce distribution of the applicant and candidate pools is
26
",0,0,0,0
356,"continuously monitored in an effort to improve the workforce distribution in the
careers that are a part of this program.
Provide breakdown of minority representation on staff?
In FY 2005, VHA’s total workforce consisted of 212,000 employees; minority
employees totaled 81,018 (88%). The breakdown of the minority representation
consisted of the following:
o Hispanics 14,441 (7%)
o Black/African American 49,769 (23%)
o Asian 14,986 (7%)
o American Indian/Alaskan Native 1,822 (1%).
Question 4: What evaluation processes does VHA have in place to hold
people accountable for their actions and to ensure consistent performance
vis-a-vis service and care for minority veterans?
0 Are bonuses/promotions attached to increase of outreach /cultural
appropriate care of minority veterans?
o Tie leader’s performance criteria to diversity of staff?
Response:
In the FY 2005 VISN Director’s performance standards, Measure 22: Diversity
and EEO Management included elements of diversity which were met by all
VISN Directors. These elements included:
0 Development of a workforce diversity analysis
0 Identification of specific strategies and measurable goals
0 Maintenance of an active Diversity Advisory Committee or similar structure
in the Network (or each facility)
o Maintenance of formal recruitment relations, such as cooperative
education or intern programs, with at least two minority-serving institutions
(e.g. Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving
Institutions, and Native American Tribal Colleges, as geographically
located)
© Provide at least three, clearly defined on-going programs offering wide
developmental opportunities available to the workforce (e.g. Upward
Mobility, SCEP/STEP, NNEI, etc).

Question 5: Please provide a written update on CARES implementation
process and future actions.
Response:
Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES) is a comprehensive,
system-wide approach to, and ongoing process for, identifying the demand for
VA care and projecting into the future the appropriate function, size and location
for VA facilities. CARES planning is not simply a one-time evaluation of VA’s
capital infrastructure and the ideal placement of VA facilities, but was undertaken
to provide a set of tools and the process to allow VA to continually plan for future
resources needed to provide quality health care to veterans.
The Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) Strategic Vision has been outlined in
the Departmental FY 2006 budget submission to Congress. This vision has been
widely distributed to Congress, veterans’ service organizations, throughout VHA
29
",0,0,0,0
359,"and the Department. In the document are some highlights of VA’s commitment
to health care planning for all veterans and notably for special populations of
veterans, as required by Public Law 107-135. VHA updated VHA Directive 2003-
064 in October 2003 that describes the strategic planning process for this
administration. This directive outlines a comprehensive planning continuum that
effectively integrates the various tasks, activities, and reporting requirements
associated with budget, capital asset, information technology, human
resources/workforce development, performance and strategic planning within
VHA.
An additional component of the strategic planning process for the FY 2006-2010
planning horizon is the merging of CARES into VHA’s strategic planning process.
The Secretary's May 2004 CARES Decision provides a blueprint for VA’s future
to effectively guide the Department forward. CARES is the creation of a set of
tools and a process for annual capital and strategic planning to enable VA to
keep its eyes fixed on the future as it plans for the resources it will need to
provide quality health care to veterans.
Current CARES initiatives, including expansion of Community-Based Outpatient
Clinics (CBOCs), identified in the CARES Decision Document have been
implemented. VA hopes to be able to proceed with review and implementation of
selected CBOCs through a national approval process. The process will require
VA medical centers and Network offices to develop sound business plans for
new CBOCs based on national criteria and standards. In FY 2005, some
Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs) began implementation of some
initiatives, including new CBOCs. This and other new initiatives must be
scrutinized within the context of the recently released FY 2006 budget. VISNs
are currently re-evaluating their needs for CBOCs and prioritizing their needs
using the Secretary’s CARES Decision Document as a guide.
The CBOC business plan review process as outlined in VHA Handbook 1006.‘
has been initiated by the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for
Operations and Management. Business plans for CBOCs that VISNs plan to
proceed with in FY 2006 will be reviewed against national CBOC planning criteria
during the second quarter of this fiscal year.
VA currently has over 712 CBOCs and operates or contracts for care at 100
outpatient clinics located in areas considered to be rural or highly rural areas.
Nationally, from 2000 to 2003, VHA added 67 CBOCs, which increased by 1
percent the number of veterans (approximately 70,000 veterans) who live within
a primary standard of 30-minute drive time.
The 2004 CARES Decision Document also called for additional studies in 18 VA
locations to refine the analyses developed in the CARES planning and decision-
making process. The study results are to be integrated into a site-specific
business plan format that provides VA decision makers and stakeholders with
30
",0,0,0,0
360,"clear options for the type, size, location, and reuse potential of VA health care
resources under study. These plans will provide VA with an independent
business analysis from which implementation decisions will be made. The
planning horizon for implementation is 2013, but any options must be projected
as viable, using demand data through 2023. The conduct of these analyses,
recommendations and conclusions will receive a great deal of scrutiny both in
and out of the Department. These decisions need to be sensitive to stakeholder
concerns within and outside the government. The decisions will be incorporated
into VHA’s Strategic Planning process.
To ensure that broad range of options were considered before a detailed analysis
was done and that stakeholders were able to comment before any options were
selected for detailed analysis, VA required that PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC),
the VA contractor, present what they considered a series of credible options.
These were based upon a very high level macro analysis. To do in-depth
analyses of all potential options in all of the seventeen study sites would be very
costly. The study design incorporates screening criteria of access, quality and
cost measure as the initial a high level of assessment. PwC used their panel of
experts to determine which of the options they initially explored would be likely to
at least maintain or improve the current access and quality of services. Those
options, as well as options that PwC had screened out as not meeting these
criteria, were presented at the second series of Local Advisory Panel (LAP)
public meetings which occurred in the summer and fall of 2005. The LAPs made
recommendations to the Secretary on options they believed deserved further
study and these along with PwC’s proposed options, are included in the study’s
Stage 1 process. VA officials are presently being briefed on the Stage | options.
The Secretary will decide which options will be considered for further analysis in
the study’s Stage II process.
Each acceptable Business Plan Option (BPO) will meet or exceed the following
screening criteria:

- Maintain or improve overall health care quality

- Maintain or improve veterans’ access to care

- Result in a cost-effective configuration of VA physical and operational

resources

- Result in a modernized, safe and secure health care delivery environment

- Maximize the re-use/redevelopment potential of VA-owned sites
To begin the final stage of the study, the LAPs will be informed in a third series of
LAP meetings to be held in early 2006 of the Secretary's decision on BPOs that
will be further analyzed. The LAP members will have an opportunity to provide
PwC with additional comments about specific options the Secretary has selected
for additional study. PwC will complete an independent analysis and recommend
one of the remaining options for implementation. The LAPs may either agree or
disagree with the recommendation. If they disagree, PwC is required to bring

3]
",0,0,0,0
361,"forward the LAP’s recommended option and PwC’s assessment with their full
evaluation in a final report to be submitted to the Secretary. All the
recommendations that PwC makes will be fully supported by appropriate data
and analysis. The Secretary will make the final decision on which business plan
option should be implemented. The current study schedule enables VA to make
the decision within the June 1, 2006, timeline regarding new hospital facilities.
All final decisions will be incorporated into VHA’s strategic planning process.
VA’s Web site www.va.gov/CARES is dedicated to veterans, elected officials and
any other interested parties, and gives them the opportunity to provide electronic
feedback and comments. They can refer to the web site for the most current
information on any of the 18 sites and upcoming LAP meeting times and
locations.
The goal of CARES is to enhance outpatient and inpatient care, as well as
special programs such as spinal cord injury, blind rehabilitation and seriously
mentally ill and long-term care. Once CARES is completed, VA will have a
national plan for directing resources where they are most needed; preserving
VA's missions and special services; and, at the same time, continuing to provide
high quality care to veterans. The initiatives and plans identified will be validated
and reassessed continually to ensure they reflect current VA policies and
priorities. ;
Question 6: The Committee is concerned that genetic testing for pre-
disposition to certain diseases may be used as a criterion to establish “pre-
existing medical conditions.” What policy safeguards can be put in place
to ensure that does not happen to the detriment of minority veterans?
Response:
The objective of VHA’s Genomic Medicine Program (GMP) is to improve
veterans’ health by delivering better medical care rather than to disenfranchise
any group of individuals selectively. A Genomic Medicine Program Advisory
Committee (GMPAC) will discuss important issues and will be sure to consider
concerns such as expressed by the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans.
Question 7: The Committee would like to see VA implement a Tribal
Veteran Representative Program (TVR) model, nationwide and develop
similar programs of support for other minority groups.
Response:
With leadership from VHA, VA is finalizing program materials to support a
national TVR Program. TVRs participating in VA's TVR program will be
identified/endorsed by the tribe as the sanctioned Tribal Representative who will
assist veteran tribal members/veterans and their families in obtaining eligible VA
32
",0,0,0,0
362,"benefits and services. The Tribal Veteran Representative program is intended to
augment the Tribal Veterans Service Officers or County Veterans Service
Officers programs that are in the community and establish links between the
veteran, Veterans Service officers, VA and the Tribal Health or Indian Health
Service. Implementation of the TVR program will be a local decision. Veterans
Integrated Service Network (VISN) staff will reach out to the tribes and implement
programs in response to local Tribal interest. Based on the success of the TVR
programs implemented in VHA's VISN 19 and VISN 23, VA staff from across the
Department, with the assistance from the VA Learning University/Employee
Education System, developed national materials that will provide a consistent set
of up-to-date training and reference information for VA outreach staff to use in
training TVRs. The TVRs will use the program materials provided by VA when
assisting American Indian/Alaska Native veterans in their Tribe and community.
Outreach assistance on or near tribal lands was identified as a need since other
sources of outreach information and assistance were not routinely reaching tribal
veterans.
At this time, VHA is unaware of any plans to develop similar programs for
additional minority veteran groups. With the possible exception of Native
Hawaiians on Hawaiian homelands, no parallel authority exists in other minority
communities that are equivalent to tribal governments.
Question 8: What programs has VHA implemented to achieve its legislated
mandate of awarding 3 percent of contracts to Service Disabled Veteran
(SDV) businesses? The Committee is concerned about the lack of
progress on this issue and whether minority veterans are included in the
Department’s SDV contract goals.
Response:
VHA has established a network of Small Business Liaisons who are responsible
for ensuring that the Small Business program in each network is active and
results-oriented. The Prosthetics and Clinical Logistics Office (P&CLO) holds
monthly teleconferences with these Liaisons to provide training, communication
of Department priorities, and an opportunity to discuss best practices and difficult
issues. Each VHA Network has developed a protocol for access to key decision
makers that includes:

e A list of key network staff wno may be contacted about business

opportunities

e Scheduled outreach events

e A communication plan

e A training plan

e Guidelines for market research

33
",0,0,0,0
363,"In addition, P&CLO has met with representatives of veterans groups to obtain
their views on how best to meet the Department goals for contracting with
veteran-owned businesses. As a result of one such meeting in January 2006,
two vendor fairs are being planned in the Gulf region in March to provide
information and networking opportunities to veteran-owned businesses who wish
to contract for the hurricane clean-up effort.
Finally, P&CLO is tracking and reporting results to senior management on a
monthly basis.
Veteran’s Benefits Administration (VBA)
Home Loan Guaranty
Native American Direct Home Loan Program
Question 1: What increased outreach efforts does VBA have planned to
increase participation in the Direct Home Loan Guaranty program and what
timelines are in place to measure increased loans to American Indian
veterans?
Response:
In response to the first question, loan Guaranty Service looks forward to
coordinating outreach with the Minority Veterans Center. It has long been a goal
of our office to work with the Minority Veterans Center to provide consistent,
timely, and accurate information to Native American veterans. While we do
provide our own outreach to this audience, we expect greater success In
reaching eligible veterans if we are able to coordinate outreach efforts with [the
Center for Minority Veterans].
The second part of the question has no definitive answer. The decision to
purchase a home is a very personal one, and there are many factors at play. For
this reason, we have never viewed the success or failure of this program as
being based on achieving certain specific numbers of loans to specific tribes.
Every veteran’s circumstances are different, as is every tribe’s reason or reasons
for participating or not participating in this program. As you are aware, the law
requires that, before we may provide a loan to a native American veteran, his or
her tribe must enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with VA setting
out the rights and responsibilities of both the tribe and the Department with
regard to property access and foreclosure procedures, in the event the veteran is
unable to meet his or her monthly mortgage obligation. We cannot make a tribe
participate, nor can we make a veteran choose a VA direct loan to finance his or
her home purchase, if he or she decides to buy a home.
34
",0,0,0,0
364,"Committee Comments to Response:

Under the authorizing legislation of the Native American Veteran Direct
Loan Program, VA is to receive $.05 (sic) million each year for administration and
outreach activities, including travel to meet with tribes and individuals.

a. What plans are currently in place by VBA to utilize these funds to

increase outreach efforts to Native communities?

Also in the program's authorizing legislation, it states that VA, among
other things, is to attend housing conferences, and provide information to
veterans, tribal governments and organization (sic). Other program requirements
state that VA should annually assess and report to the Congress on the
effectiveness of its outreach activities and annually report on the pool of eligible
Native American veterans.

b. Are the current figures reflecting the activity of the program over the

last thirteen years being reported to Congress annually?

The Committee requests a follow-up briefing from VBA to address the
concerns delineated above.

Department of Veterans Affairs
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Policy (008A)
Question 1: Provide the Committee with the law or regulation and VA’s
interpretation of the law or regulation that precludes the Department of
Veterans Affairs from collecting race and ethnicity data from veterans.
Response:
There is no VA regulation per se we can point to which precludes VA from
systematically collecting race/ethnicity data from veterans on its administrative
forms. As discussed in December, various VA organizations do collect race and
ethnicity as part of their on-going processes based on specific needs using the
OMB race and ethnic categories. For health purposes, race and ethnic data rare
collected because race and ethnicity are seen as risk factors in the health of
veterans. On housing loan forms, race and ethnicity are asked as a matter of law
pertaining to all federal housing—viz., to monitor discrimination in housing. Race
and ethnicity data is not collected as part of the C&P claims filing process to
insure that benefits are not contingent on race and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity
data is also collected as part of survey research studies such as the National
Survey of Veterans.
35
",0,0,0,0
365,"The Office of Policy has recently completed a review of VA's collection of this
type data. Such data does exist in various data bases that would facilitate
matching of records to provide a yearly report on the utilization of VA benefits by
race and ethnic category. Our plan is to begin compilation of this report at the
end of FY 2006.
Department of Veterans Affairs

Assistant Secretary for Human Resources and Administration
Question 1: When will the Community Prosperity Partnership (CPP) be
used for outreach for all minority groups?
Response:
The CPP is a pilot project for the Hispanic communities in four pilot sites. The
pilot seeks to establish a model framework to expand outreach efforts to Hispanic
veterans during 2006. VA will assess the results of all CPP pilot sites and will
share information on effective practices when it is available. Once CPP is proven
effective, the CPP model will be implemented for all minority groups.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
October 23-27, 2006
Anchorage, Alaska Site Visit

The Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans (ACMV) visited the Greater
Anchorage, Alaska VA Health Care System, Anchorage VBA Regional Office,
Anchorage National Cemetery Administration, Alaska Native Medical Center, and
Coordinated Care Consortium/Joint Venture at Elmendorf Air Force Base during
October 23-27, 2006. Alaska was selected because of its diverse minority
veteran population, remote location, and the challenges veterans encounter
when they attempt to secure benefits and services from the Department of
Veterans Affairs. The Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans was interested
in assessing the delivery of all VA services and benefits to a varied minority
population with no specific concentration in and around large communication
networks. The Alaska Native beneficiary population could be characterized as
mostly rural and located in villages throughout the state.

Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city and only official metropolitan area, has a
population of about 260,300 or 42% of the total state population. The Fairbanks
North Star Borough is the next most populous at 66,180. The third largest city in
size is Juneau, with 30,/11 residents. Juneau is the only state capital in the
United States with no road access from other major metropolitan cities in Alaska
and must be accessed by air or sea. The land mass of Alaska is vast and has a
geographic peninsula with about 33,900 miles of shoreline; more than all of the
contiguous states combined. Communities in Alaska are rarely accessible by
road. There is one main highway in the state, running essentially from Homer on
the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage through Anchorage, north to Fairbanks,
and then east to Canada. Seventy-five percent (75%) of Alaska communities are
not connected by road to a community with a hospital. This necessitates the
development of creative and often expensive travel alternatives that greatly
impact access and costs for health care as well as all other services.

Alaska’s sheer size is incredible and unique. Alaska is a world apart from
its “siblings” in the lower 48 states and their challenges/issues take on an entirely
different perspective. What may appear to be a minor problem or issue in the
lower 48 states is maximized in Alaska which becomes a major challenge.

The challenges for the VA in providing services to the veterans’ population
(11.48% or 72,000 of Alaska’s population) are influenced, affected, and/or
hampered by the uniqueness of several factors: demographics, geography,
transportation, infrastructure, high cost of living, and the existence or non-
existence of parallel healthcare systems in the state.

3
",0,0,0,0
379,"The unalterable realities of the large veteran and rural population, lack of
surface transportation, high cost of air transportation, and travel time required to
access central medical facilities define the unique challenges that must be
overcome if a VA healthcare system is to provide services to veterans living in
both rural and non-rural Alaska.

Because of these difficult challenges, a majority of the Alaska Native
veterans utilize the services offered through the Alaska Native Medical Center
and some Alaska Native veterans living in urban areas use the VA health care
system. There are no statistics available locally to document the extent to which
dual eligible recipients use one system preferentially over the other or access
both. The unique difficulties identified above fall heavily on the non-Native
Alaska veteran rural population since a well-developed health care system Is in
place to serve only the American Indian and Alaska Natives in Alaska.

Throughout the report, the Committee makes reference to VA as the entity
for policy, management, and execution. Within that context, the Committee
recognized that the Department has three major administrations: Veterans
Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and
National Cemetery Administration (NCA).

Committee identified nine (9) recommendations:

1. VA establish the feasibility of implementing a cooperative agreement
with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC); Alaska Tribal Health
System; Alaska Area Indian Health Service (IHS); Alaska Native Medical Center
(ANMC); and Southcentral Foundation (SCF) to provide all services which fall
within the purview of VHA. This would include the following actions:

a. VA reimburse those entities, through ANTHC, for all services rendered

to Alaska Native veterans enrolled with VHA.

b. VA conduct a feasibility study to examine whether the ANTHC can

provide same services that can be offered to the general veteran

population (non Alaska Natives) which may be located in close proximity
to rural areas and villages throughout the State of Alaska.

c. VA develops, coordinates, and submits all legislative initiatives for

enactment of cooperative agreements, and/or elimination/modifications of

statutes, which might impede the establishment and/or consummation of
those agreements.

d. VA recognize the influence and importance of Alaska Native Elders and

that VA coordinates with and secures the approval of these Elders before

finalizing and implementing cooperative agreements.

",0,0,0,0
380,"2. Secretary and Deputy Secretary encourage VA leadership officials to
utilize all available means (i.e. Internships, Mentoring Programs, Executive
Career Field Training Programs, Leadership VA, SES Candidate Development
Program) to promote the career development of VA employees. The ultimate
goal will be to increase the number of VA minority group employees in leadership
positions throughout the Department.

3. VA outreach programs are extended and/or modified to include all
means and processes to advise minority veterans of their entitlements and the
Office of National Outreach Program Coordination provides the Committee a
report reflecting actions initiated to date.

4. VA ensures that translation services are available in VA facilities
through either the services of employee translators or contract services. This will
ensure “Patients’ Rights and Responsibilities” functions normally assigned to
VHA are being addressed.

5. The current appointment processes and procedures contained in VHA
Directive 2006-055, VHA Outpatient Scheduling Processes and Procedures, be
adhered to by the Alaska VAMC and other VHA facilities to ensure that veterans
are not penalized unfairly, and that veterans’ needs for health care services are
fully met. This could be monitored during reviews under the current SOARS
process.

6. VA, under the VA’s State Cemetery Grants Program, facilitate
discussions with the government officials of the state of Alaska and Alaska
Native tribal leaders to explore the possibility of establishing additional veterans’
cemeteries on either state or tribal lands.

7. Replicate the Joint Venture initiative VA has with the Elmendorf Air
Force Base hospital in Fairbanks Alaska with the U. S. Army.

8. VA develops and implements a Tribal Veterans Representative (TVR)
program in Alaska.

9. The Alaska VA Regional Office should partner with the Indian Health
Services (IHS) to provide outreach to Alaska Natives.

Washington, DC Meeting

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) convened at the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office in Washington DC for their
administrative annual meeting on April 16 —19, 2007.

The Committee was indeed privileged to hear reports presented by
Honorable R. James Nicholson, Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
and other VA senior leadership personnel representing the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and National
Cemetery Administration (NCA). The Committee was particularly pleased with a
most informative and insightful presentation from a panel of District of Columbia
National Guard members of a Military Police Battalion who have recently
returned from an Operation Iraqi Freedom Deployment. The presentation
highlighted the unit’s first-hand experiences and reaction to their tour of duty in
lrag and provided the Committee with honest and candid observations, which
bolstered the Committee’s pride in our military service members who have
served, continue to serve, and sacrifice on behalf of our Global War on
Terrorism.

The Committee was touched by a most spirited presentation given by an
energetic African-American female Army soldier who had her leg amputated, as
a result of an improvised explosive device, while serving in Iraq. She was
undergoing rehabilitation medical treatment at the Walter Reed Army Medical
Center. Joined by her mother, she described in detail her recovery challenges
and successes while receiving what she considered excellent treatment at Walter
Reed. Her responses to the questions greatly impressed the Committee who
were all touched by her pride in her military service, her strong will and
determination to recover from her medical condition, and to succeed in her
pursuit of her life goals and objectives.

Committee identified four (4) recommendations:

1. VA expeditiously complies with the VA Acting General Counsel
Opinion, Subject: WEBCIMS 37291 7-Collection of Veterans Ethnic and Racial
Demographic Data, dated March 2, 2007.

2. Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) provides information on their
budget, employee resources, and accomplishment of their performance
measures to the Committee during the next Washington, DC meeting.

3. CMV consider the necessity for sponsoring a Minority Veterans
National Conference or Summit to provide outreach and veterans’ benefits and

6
",0,0,0,0

concerns and issues adversely affecting minority veterans.

4. VA analyze its reported VA workforce minority employee statistics to
ensure that they are consistent with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
reporting of workforce minority employee statistics and ensure the accuracy and
sustainability of conclusions concerning representation of VA minority workforce.

383,"INTRODUCTION

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) responsibilities
includes advising the Secretary and Congress on the administration of VA
benefits and services to and for minority veterans. The Committee conducts site
visits, holds town hall meetings, and meets with VA officials to ensure accurate
and meaningful recommendations are set forth each year in the annual report to
ensure better services for minority veterans.

From October 24 — 26, 2006 the Committee conducted a site visit to the
Greater Anchorage, Alaska VA Health Care System, Anchorage VBA Regional
Office, Anchorage National Cemetery Administration, Alaska Native Medical
Center, and Coordinated Care Consortium/Joint Venture at Elmendorf Air Force
Base. Since one of the primary purposes was to look at outreach efforts
extended to minority veterans in light of cultural sensitivity and frequency, the
Committee was exposed to issues that affected all veterans.

The Committee’s visit to the Greater Anchorage, Alaska VA Health Care
System left an indelible mark on the members because of the sheer size of the
state of Alaska and the major issues on accessibility faced by all veterans. The
uniqueness of the state suggests that innovative management processes and
partnerships would be the main stay to support the veteran population in Alaska.
Understanding the problems and issues faced by VA in supporting the
beneficiary population requires an extensive look at Alaska. The following map
provides a perspective on the size of Alaska compared to the lower 48 States.

Alaska is the largest state in the union, with 586,412 square miles of
territory. It is more than 2 ’% times the size of Texas; the next largest state.
Overlaid on a map of the lower 48 contiguous states, Alaska stretches from the
Atlantic to the Pacific and from Mexico to Canada. Its north-south dimension is
1,420 miles and east-west is 2,400 miles. Alaska is the 49th state joining the
United States in 1959. Its population totaled 626,932 in the 2000 Census.

8
",0,0,0,0
384,"Anchorage, the largest city and only official metropolitan area, has a population
of about 260,300, or 42% of the total.

The Fairbanks North Star Borough is the next most populous at 66,180.
The third largest city in size is Juneau, with 30,/11 residents. Juneau is the only
state capital in the United States with no road access and must be accessed by
air or sea.

The land mass of Alaska is vast and is a geographic peninsula with about
33,900 miles of shoreline; more than all of the contiguous states combined.
Communities in Alaska are rarely accessible by road. There are three main
highways in the state running essentially from Homer on the Kenai Peninsula
south of Anchorage through Anchorage, north to Fairbanks, and then east to
Canada. The highway north from Palmer is less traveled and less maintained.

There are vast areas of the state with no road connections at all. Seventy-
five percent (75%) of Alaska’s communities are not connected to a community
with a hospital with roads. This necessitates the development of creative and
often expensive travel alternatives that greatly impact access and costs for health
care, as well as, all other services.

Alaska’s sheer size is incredible and unique. Alaska is a world apart from
its “siblings” in the Continental United States (CONUS), and its challenges/issues
take on an entirely different perspective. What may appear to be a minor
problem or issue in the CONUS or in the lower 48 states is maximized in Alaska
and becomes a major problem.

Challenge:

The challenge for the VA in providing services to the veterans’ population
in Alaska is influenced by uniqueness of several factors in the state:
demographics, geography, transportation, infrastructure, high cost of living, and
the non-existence of parallel health care systems in remote areas of the state.

Eleven and a half percent (11.48% or 72,000) of Alaska’s population are
veterans. Of those veterans, twelve percent (12%) come from the Second World
War (WW Il) and the Korean Conflict. The greatest numbers of veterans (63%)
emanate from the Vietnam Conflict (38%) and Desert Shield/Desert Storm (25%).
These percentages will change substantially over the next two years given that
so many soldiers from Alaska have recently deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.

It is estimated that 80% of the veteran population resides within the
greater Anchorage and Fairbanks areas; the only portions of Alaska
interconnected by roads. The rest of the veteran population is spread out
throughout the rural areas of Alaska and are not reachable except by aircraft or

9
",0,0,0,0
385,"by boats. Approximately half of the populations residing in the rural areas are
Alaska Natives.

The 52,000 veterans residing in the urban areas connected by road are
served by medical facilities at Anchorage, Kenai, and Fairbanks. The rest of the
veteran population must fly to the Anchorage or Fairbanks area for the availability
of any medical service within the VA system. There are some Alaska Native
clinical facilities in the rural areas that are more readily accessible than VA
facilities to the 8% of veterans who are Alaska Natives.

There is no Level | Trauma Center in the entire state and the only Level Il
Trauma Center was recently certified at the VA Medical Center in Anchorage.
Many specialty services must be accessed in the lower 48 states. Patients
requiring those specialty services must be transported to the lower 48 states.
Even if there were a reasonable number of health care providers located in one
community, in a borough or census area, residents of other communities within
that area would have to travel hundreds of miles to reach the providers via air or
water.

Health Professional shortage in Alaska:

Most of Alaska is designated with some form of Health Professional
Shortage Areas (HPSA) status. Statewide, 370,088 or approximately 59% of the
state’s residents are classified as underserved. This percentage may be
understated because 23 of 27 Boroughs/Census Areas are either:

Whole or part Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P) or

Governor-designated Medically Underserved Population (MUP)
Alaska’s Physicians:

Forty-Nine (49%) of all physicians in Alaska are primary care physicians
(2002 data.) Compare that with the U.S. average which is twenty-eight percent
(28 %.)

Alaska is forty-eighth in “doctors to residents” ratio. Sixty-five percent
(65%) of the physicians are located in Anchorage.

There are shortages in many of or even in all specialties.

Twenty-five percent (25%) Alaskans or forty-six percent (46%) of Alaska
Natives live in communities of less than 1000 people.

Approximately 579 Community Health Aides, servicing some 200 villages,
provide nearly 7% million encounters each year.

10
",0,0,0,0
386,"Air Transportation:

The cost of air transportation from outlying villages to existing VA medical
facilities in Fairbanks or Anchorage averages $900.00 round trip for the most
part. In effect, access to the centralized health services is severely limited and
unavailable; particularly when the low levels of income of the rural residents is
taken into account. Although the VA reimburses the cost of transportation and
lodging for eligible veterans who must travel to access medical services, there
are eligibility criteria for veterans — 30 to 50% service-connected and a maximum
income of $9,400.00 for non-service connected.

The unalterable realities of the large veteran and rural population is the
lack of surface transportation, the high cost of air transportation, and the time
required to travel to access the central medical facilities define the unique
challenges that must be overcome if a VA healthcare system is to provide
services to veterans living in both rural and non-rural Alaska.

The high cost of living in Alaska coupled with high unemployment rates in
the outlying villages create conditions of subsistence living for many of the
Alaska Native veterans in these areas. Their need to take advantage of the
fishing season in the spring time and the hunting season in the fall constrains
their availability to fly into the urban areas for consultations and treatment. For
the same reason, the provision of traveling medical services to the villages is
somewhat impractical because the veterans are not available.

Because of these difficulties, a majority of the Alaska Native veterans
utilizes the services of the Alaska Native healthcare system although some
Alaska Natives use the VA healthcare system in the urban areas. There are no
statistics available locally to document the extent to which dual eligible recipients
use one system preferentially over the other or access both.

The unique difficulties identified above fall heavily on the non-Native
Alaska veteran rural population because the well-developed Alaska Native
healthcare system currently in place can only be utilized by American Indian and
Alaska Natives.

Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System (GAVAHCS)

The Director, Alaska VA Health Care System, Anchorage, Alaska,
presented a very comprehensive brief on Alaska, the VA healthcare system, the
challenges faced by all — beneficiaries and providers — in its ability to identify
benefits to receive and provide care to all beneficiaries.

Current Staffing is approximately 410 employees. The focus is on hiring
Alaska Natives. The Committee noted that there were very few Alaska Natives,
Asians or Pacific Islanders on the staff. The following chart illustrates the
diversity and Alaskan workforce.

The following illustrates the Diversity and Employment Demographics-Employees
Focus Demographics of Alaska VHA Workforce (Does not reflect senior staff
demographics):

The Alaska VHA has 410 FTEE of which 30% are minorities.

- African American/Black 16.5% (RCLF 7.13%)

- American Indian/Alaska Native 4.87% (RCLF 8.97%)

- Asian American/Pacific Islander 4.39% (RCLF 3.68%)

Issues impacting on access and delivery of care to eligible veterans:
1. Travel distances in Alaska impact accessibility and often requires one
or more modes of transportation:
a. Travel by air, which is very costly.
b. Travel by car ts limited; there are only three major road networks.
c. Travel by boat limits access to VA facilities.
12
",0,0,0,0
388,"d. Travel by dog sled limits access to the same facilities.

Access to care is further complicated by the facts that most Alaska
Veterans must travel to Anchorage for specialty care. The VA initially paid travel
benefits, which were curtailed, and reinstated on October 1, 2006.

2. Recruitment/employment of health care personnel.

The VA continues to be burdened by its limited capabilities to attract,
recruit, and retain health care personnel. There are no medical schools within
the local areas of Anchorage and Fairbanks. There is one nursing school. The
Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System was allocated $3 Million to recruit
more personnel but VA fell short of its goal because of the cost of living and the
climate in Alaska.

3. In evaluating health resources for the system in Alaska, one needs to
consider the following:

a. Veteran population is the highest per capita of any state in the

nation. Approximately 11.48% of the population is veterans.

b. Female veterans have grown to about 7%.

c. The majority of the veterans are concentrated around Anchorage.

Kenai is 160 miles from Anchorage with Fairbanks being 350 miles.
The Committee noted that when employees traveled to the lower
48 states for vacation, they stayed a minimum of two weeks

before returning home to Alaska. These lengthy stays creates
staffing shortages for VA.

d. The veteran population is younger.

e. Alaska has the fastest growing population over 65.

f. The 52,000 veterans residing in the urban areas connected by road,

are served by medical facilities in Anchorage, Kenai, and Fairbanks.
The rest of the veteran population must fly to the Anchorage or
Fairbanks area for the availability of any medical services within the
VA system. There are some American Native clinical facilities in
the rural areas that are more readily accessible than VA facilities to
the 8% of veterans who are Alaska Natives.

g. There is no Level | Trauma Center in the entire state and the only

Level Il Trauma Center was recently certified at the VA Medical

Center in Anchorage. Many specialty services must be accessed in

the lower 48 states. Patients requiring specialty services must be
13
",0,0,0,0
389,"transported to the lower 48 states. It is worthy to note that 23 of the

2/ boroughs and census areas have been identified/designated

Medically Underserved Area/Population (MUA/P) or governor-

designated Medically Underserved Population (MUP). Statewide,

there is a total underserved population of 370,088. Even if there

were a reasonable number of health care providers located in a

community, in a borough or census area, residents of other

communities within that area would have to travel hundreds of
miles to reach the providers via air or water.

h. Specialty care is limited within the Greater Anchorage VA Health
Care System. This requires flying Veterans to Seattle (1,500 miles
away) or to other states having the appropriate specialties, for
definitive care. The cost for air transportation (approximately 900
trips a year), lodging, etc. is borne by the VA. Veterans located in
and around the Juneau area utilize the VA Health Care System in
Seattle, Washington, because of its close proximity to the Capital of
Alaska.

i. The Medicare rate in Alaska is much higher, at least 30%, than in
the lower 48 states. Local physicians within the Anchorage area,
have in the past, refused to care for Medicare patients/veterans
within the community. This situation continues to exist despite the

fact that the Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System had been
given the authority to establish a “special medical care plus rate.”

j. The Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System offers limited
Mental Health services at Fairbanks and Anchorage. VA HCS also
uses state and local facilities to assist/augment/supplement in the
delivery of mental health services.

4. The Committee noted, with particular interest and attention, some of
the steps which have been implemented in Alaska to improve the health care
system. The Committee takes this opportunity to highlight and comment, as
required, on those steps:

a. Reimbursement of care:

(1) The Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System developed a
market based rate to keep pace with Medicare and to reimburse
providers for their services.

(2) VA staff holds monthly vendor meetings with physicians and
other providers to insure that payments are made on time. The
Committee noted that there were insufficient specialty
physicians in the community. The impact on VA can be quite

14
",0,0,0,0
390,"expensive since most patients must travel to the lower 48 states
for specialty care. Furthermore, it appeared that care under the
TRICARE system was limited because there was no excess
capacity within the community. The Greater Anchorage VA
Health Care System was in the process of getting the same
TRICARE rate applied to Alaska.

b. The Greater Anchorage VA Health Care System, in coordination

with the VISN, is currently assessing its long term care needs.

c. Joint Venture Elmendorf AFB:

(1) This initiative with Elmendorf Air Force Base should be
replicated in Fairbanks with the U.S. Army Medical facility.
Concurrently, VA should endeavor to forge similar processes
with Department of Defense (DOD). The Committee recognizes
that VA and the U.S. Air Force have joint ventures in other
states and those relationships are working extremely well and
have been a model of cooperation and resource sharing, as
envisioned by the Congress in 1982. Although the issue of
interfacing both VA and DOD medical records continues to be
predominant, it did not seem to negatively impact on the
cooperation between and utilization of personnel assigned to
the two different departments; VA and DOD. The Committee
recognizes that there was no integration on medical records. In
fact two automated systems were set up; one for the Air Force
active duty personnel and one for veterans. That issue was
addressed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense Health Affairs.
The cooperation and coordination between Air Force and VA
personnel were noteworthy.

(2) The number of VA personnel at the military facility was close to
70 FTE and VA expected that number to grow significantly. The
benefits of the relationship could be found in the area of
orthopedics, where orthopedic surgeries could be performed at
the Elmendorf medical facility, rather than traveling to Seattle,
Washington for the same procedures.

(3) Lastly, there were plans for a new facility at Elmendorf Air Force
Base dedicated specifically for use by the Greater Anchorage
VA Health Care System. The new VA health care facility will be
built on Air Force property and both buildings, Elmendorf AFB
and VA will be linked at the new site.

(4) The relationship with Elmendorf had other significant benefits
for veterans. For example, prescriptions were provided under

15
",0,0,0,0
391,"TRICARE at no cost to the VA beneficiary. There was no co-
payment.
d. Partnerships:

(1) The Committee noted with great enthusiasm that partnering
with other health care agencies appeared to be a great system
to maximize health care delivery to the beneficiary population in
Alaska. The Committee also noted, in particular, the levels of
partnership with other agencies, such as, the Alaska Federal
Health Care Partnership (AFHCP).

(2) The AFHCP’s operations extended to all major communities,
within the state of Alaska, with a beneficiary population of about
283,000.

(3) The Committee also noted the interaction and interdependency
between the VA and the Indian Health Service (IHS). In fact,
several initiatives have been consummated to bring necessary
services to beneficiaries. The following VA/IHS Initiatives at the
executive level bears to be highlighted:

(a) MOU has been signed with VISN 20, Portland area
IHS Office, and Alaska Area Indian Health Service (IHS).
(ob) Alaska Federal Health Care Partnership.
(c) Tested connectivity with Manilag Association for
screening for veterans industrial/Homeless Veterans
Services.
(d) VA facility Alaska Native Outreach Committee consisting of
VHA, VBA, and Vet Center.
Veterans Benefits Administration
The Director, Anchorage/Ft. Harrison/Salt Lake City Regional Office,
briefed the Committee on the Veterans Benefits Administration, their challenges,
and efforts to maximize beneficiaries’ access. The state of Alaska does not
follow the traditional county alignment that is prevalent in the lower 48 states.
Alaska follows an organization akin to a business. Alaska is divided into
corporations or regions that impacts on effective program coordination and
management. The management of VBA has evolved significantly over the past
three years. A 2003 survey, commissioned by the Under Secretary for Benefits
showed several VBA agencies and 9 VAMROC’s managed by VHA managers.

For example:

a. VSO’s haven't established strong service officers in the field to
outreach to veterans regarding their benefits.

b. Partnership opportunities lack initiatives to partner with the Native or
minority organizations.

c. The following initiative, develop and Implement a Tribal Veterans
Representative (TVR) Program in Alaska for 2007, is both an issue
and a future activity. It falls under the former because ANMC’s
representatives have declined to participate in the TVR training
program.

d. Increase utilization of the internet. Rural areas in Alaska “lack”
internet connectivity. Further, the internet can be a great asset in
recruiting personnel. Yet, it does require communication with
Veterans’ groups, in particular those representing Alaska Natives
regarding job announcements. Experience has shown that the
starting salary is significantly lower than what is offered by Tribal
organizations. There is a need to insure that VR&E coordinator’s
Initiative include all ethnic groups and Vocational Rehabilitation
Counselors ensure that veterans enrolled within the program are
fully aware of vacancies within the VA.

2. There is a need to develop and implement the Tribal Veterans

Representative (TVR) Program in Alaska for 2007.

Fort Richardson National Cemetery

The Director, Fort Richardson National Cemetery discussed their budget of
$750,000.00 for Fiscal Year 2006. Staffing included the Director and two other
employees. During a four year hiatus, 1998-2003, there was a thirty percent
(30%) increase in burials at the National Cemetery. The Director attributed that
increase to the cost of private burials within the State of Alaska.

1. Burials at the National Cemetery do present some challenges. The

Cemetery is located on the Army Installation — Fort Richardson. For

security reasons, the Military Police must be given twenty-four (24)

hours notice of a burial to grant access to all participants, at the main

gate of the Installation. All participants, except for Retired and Active

Military personnel, are “confined” to the burial ground during and after

the ceremony, and must vacate the premises. The Fort Richardson

complex has approximately 200 burials per year; whereas Sitka, which
consists of 6 acres, has a caseload of 35 burials per year.

the services; Army, Navy (including the Marines), and the Air Force.

Every branch of service (DOD) is not consistent and uniform in their

support of military honors.

Telehealth System

The Care Coordination Home Telehealth (CCHT) Program Manager
informed the Committee that the system was implemented on October 31, 2005
and received its first enrollees on January 31, 2006. Currently, 66 veterans are
enrolled in the system but there are no Alaska Natives enrolled.

$38 million dollars have been allocated for telehealth, whose capability
consists only of 55 lines. Data is translated from LAN line; cellular
communication is much too expensive to use. A live demonstration did show the
utility of the system but it also showed its liabilities in terms of cost, staffing, and
limitations.
VA Domiciliary

The Chief, Homeless Veterans Service, briefed the Committee on the
Homeless Program. The Committee visited the domiciliary residential facilities
which were being renovated. The Committee met with some of the residents,
who recounted their personal stories, and explained how the program has
benefited them in their quest for rehabilitation. All were very complimentary of
the staff and of the program.
Elmendorf Air Force Base

Commander of the Medical Treatment Facility, Elmendorf AFB provided
the Committee with an overview of the State of Alaska. As noted in previous
presentations, the state is “extremely rural” and must adjust to severe weather
conditions. Elmendorf Air Force Base is the states largest Air Force installation.

1. Elmendorf Medical Treatment Facility and VHA:

The facility and VHA operates on a joint venture modality. The
treatment facility was dedicated and opened in May 1999 and occupies
433,922 square feet. Of the total cost of $191,000,000.00, VA contributed
$11,000,000.00. The facility consists of 110 fully staffed beds. The
staffing between the two agencies, Air Force and VHA, is fully
integrated in the management and operation processes.

A new VA clinic was approved for construction on the grounds of the
installation just outside the Muldoon Gate of Elmendorf Air Force Base
with the Department of the Air Force granting land use permit for the
construction of the clinic. Construction of the clinic is projected for
completion in FY 2009 with additional space totaling 180,243 gross
square footage (GSF) versus the current Air Force clinic space of
112,000 GSF.

3. Identified two major priorities:

a. Timely access to quality healthcare for active duty, guard, reserve,

families, retirees, and deserving patriots.

b. Expansion of collaboration with the Alaska VA and Alaska

Federal Health Care Partners (AFHCP) which includes: DOD, US

Coast Guard, Alaska VA Healthcare System & Regional Office,

Alaska Indian Health Service, Alaska Native Tribal Health

Consortium, and Alaska Native Medical Center.
4. Following the Commander's presentation, the Committee toured the
Elmendorf DOD/VA Joint Venture facility. VHA staff was fully integrated
with the Air staff at all agreed upon levels. In other areas, VHA staff
was charged with full management and operation of clinic and/or service.
Yet, despite what appeared to be an excellent model for joint venture, the
Committee noted the operation and management of two separate records
systems. In clinics, there were two automated systems; one for active
duty military and the other for Veterans. (Note: The subject of medical
records integration between DOD and VA has been and is the subject of
congressional initiatives. The Assistant Secretary of Defense, Health
Affairs indicated that full integration may not be possible until the years
2010 to 2012.)

Wednesday, October 25, 2006

Undoubtedly, today was the most productive day. Productive from the
standpoint that the Committee was able to assess the delivery of care to Native
Alaskans and was able to extract a promise that could open care to non-Alaska
Native veterans located in the outer regions of the state.

The day began with the Native Tribal Leadership panel that included the
CEO, Alaska Tribal Health System and the Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium (ANTHC); Director, Alaska Area Indian Health Service (IHS); Active
CEO, Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC); and the Southcentral Foundation
(SCF).

Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC)

The CEO provided an overview of ANTHC which includes the Alaska
Tribal Health System. ANTHC was established in late 1997. Their charter is to
manage all statewide IHS programs, including the Alaska Area Native Health
Service, Indian Health Service, and the Alaska Native Medical Center. ANTHC is
based in Anchorage and is the largest tribal self-governance entity in the U.S.
with over 1700 employees.

The Alaska Tribal Health System consists of 12 “unaffiliated” tribes, which
manage and provide their own community-based health programs and 14
regional health organizations which are non-profit. Their charter is authorized
and governed by tribal government resolutions under boards of directors
composed of Alaska Natives.

1. Alaska Tribal Health System Levels of Care:

a. Village-based services: 550 Community Health Aide/Practitioners
working in 180 village clinics.
b. Sub-regional services (some regions): Mid-level practitioners
serving several villages.
c. Regional services: Referral hospital or physician health center.
d. Statewide services: Alaska Native Medical Center.
e. Contract Health Services: For private sector referrals.
Alaska Tribal Health System operates in concert with Native Health
20
",0,0,0,0
396,"Corporations under contract with IHS. Their referral pattern blankets the entire
state of Alaska. Despite their successes and abilities to deliver care to a
dispersed population, ANTHC faces many challenges:
2. Health System Challenges:
a. Congressional support to maintain and augment core health
services funding.
b. Replacement of aging/inadequate hospitals and health centers
(i.e. Barrow and Nome).
c. Maintaining operating efficiencies in a decentralized health system.
d. Supply and retention of health professionals.
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) must endeavor to meet
all challenges in delivering care to its dispersed beneficiary population.
3. IHS does not cover all Native health care; funding levels restrict certain
services:
a. Adult dental care.
b. Skilled nursing care.
c. Rehabilitation and substance abuse treatment.
d. High-cost complex medical treatment.
e. High costs of medical technology and pharmaceuticals.
4. To meet those challenges, ANTHC:
a. Requires congressional support to maintain and augment core
health services funding.
b. Must plan for replacement of aging/inadequate hospitals and health
Centers (i.e. Barrow and Nome).
c. Must be innovative in maintaining operating efficiencies in a
decentralized health system.
d. Must find means to minimize the supply and retention of health
professionals.
21
",0,0,0,0
397,"e. Must contend with high population growth in the Native community
(3.8% a year).

f. Must assess the impacts of regulation and compliance.

g. Must endeavor to stay at the forefront of information/technology
requirements.

h. Must find means to deal with substantially higher costs of providing
services in isolated rural communities.

ANTHC developed several initiatives to maximize its services to Alaska
Natives and to be a major force in the delivery of care. Their focus on the use of
technology, among others, is designed to ensure access to the remotest areas of
the state.

5. Major Alaska Native Health Program Initiatives:

a. Development of elderly health services and more long-term care
alternatives.

b. Domestic violence and child abuse prevention.

c. Medical evacuation system improvements.

d. Enhancement of Alaska Native health research.

e. Sustained telehealth network/electronic health record deployment.

f. Developing Alaska Native health care administrators and clinical
providers.

g. Replacement and renovation of village primary care facilities,
health centers, and two hospitals.

h. Optimizing third party reimbursements.

i. Partnering with other health systems and institutions (i.e. Denali
Commission, University, HHS, State, foundations, private sector).

The ACMV noted the similarities between ANTHC and VA in the
challenges faced by each entity and the initiatives which each organization would
resort and implement; to provide the best and most effective care to their
constituents. The Committee recognized the limitations that each agency faces
or may face as it embarks on developing solutions for maximum coverage and
entitlements. Yet, the Committee supports the desirability of partnering with

22
",0,0,0,0
398,"ANTHC; including IHS and other Native consortium to provide and extend
coverage to all veterans throughout the state of Alaska. The Committee was of
the opinion that all avenues and impediments, including legislative, should be
explored and changed as necessary to maximize delivery of care and
entitlements to all veterans in Alaska.

Alaska Area Native Health Service and Indian Health Service (AANHS-IHS)

Director, Indian Health Service, addressed related activities pertaining to
the IHS in Alaska, their enactment and legislative historical perspective. Their
mission and goal is to raise the physical, mental, social, and traditional health of
American Indians and Alaska Natives to the highest level. Their beginning found
themselves in the Snyder Act, Indian Health Care Improvement Act, Treaties and
Case Laws (note: Tribes are considered “Domestic Sovereign Nations), and
Indian Self Determination & Education Assistance Act (Government to
Government Relationship with 231 federally recognized tribes). Their mission is
to make Tribal Self-Determination work for all.

Tribal Self-Determination: The Experience

- Tribes and Tribal organizations have assumed Programs, Functions,
Services, and Activities (PFSA’s) since mid-1970s.

- Authority to Reprogram and Redesign.

- Conducts their own health needs assessments.

- Tribes have broadened the scope and depth of service offerings
beyond which a federal agency can provide.

IHS concentrates on functions that cannot be performed by tribes. IHS
manages the 6 regional hospitals located in the communities of Barrow, Bethel,
Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome, and Sitka; the 28 tribal health centers and other
health facilities. Additionally, IHS oversees and manages 40 contractual
arrangements and agreements to provide health service to approximately
125,000 Native Alaskans. IHS complexity is striking when one considers their
profile, sohere of operations, and all the activities they interact with and
supervises.

Alaska Area Profile

- Area Office IHS is located in Anchorage with a staff of 37 (22 are
federal residual and the remaining are transitional federal, buy-back,
IAA, or PSC positions).

- Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (tribally managed by all tribes
in Alaska) is responsible for statewide services and ANMC; in
conjunction with Southcentral Foundation, the local Anchor tribal
healthcare organization for purposes of P.L. 930-638.

23
",0,0,0,0
399,"- Other federal agencies, such as the Arctic Investigations Laboratory of
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Alaska Federal Health
Care Partnership (AFHCP) members, work closely with IHS and tribes
to improve the health status of Alaska Natives.
- Alaska Area IHS works with 40 different contractual arrangements with
tribal organizations to provide comprehensive health services to
125,000 Alaska Natives.

- There are 18 Title | contracts, 26 grants, and one Title V compact with
22 funding agreements.

- Alaska tribes administer 99% of IHS funds earmarked for Alaska.

- There are 6 regional hospitals located in communities of Barrow,
Bethel, Dillingham, Kotzebue, Nome and Sitka.

- 28 tribal health centers/other health facilities.

- 176 community health aide clinics throughout the State.

- The Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC) in Anchorage serves as the

Area’s referral center and gatekeeper for specialty care.

ANMC’s referral pattern is astonishing. They provide coverage for the
entire state. Their superimposition on the Continental United States (CONUS) is
really designed to give the reader a perspective on the system, its reach, pattern,
and the distances it must negotiate.

Alaska Native Medical Center

The ANMC is the third part of the triad of the Alaska Tribal Health System
and Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. The Interim Hospital Administrator
presented a comprehensive and informative briefing on the Medical Center.
ANMC is owned and operated by the people it serves. The Alaska Natives,
Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, and Southcentral Foundation have
joined efforts to provide excellent quality care and customer service. They work
together to achieve wellness by providing the highest quality health services for
all Alaska Natives.

Southcentral Foundation (SCF)

The Vice President, Primary Care, Southcentral Foundation, gave a
comprehensive presentation on SCF’s 22 year history on staffing (approximately
1,300), mission, functions, ownership, management of 20 privately owned
medical primary care systems, and clientele. SCF provides services to a
clientele of 45,000 Alaska Natives to include 10,000 in over 50 remote villages.

SCF’s experience, philosophy and tenets were striking. They find roots
with the Elders, their experiences, and their wisdom. Their system is based on
Native values:

1. SCF Experience:

24
",0,0,0,0
400,"a. Complex systems theory; provide us ways to describe our
experience.
b. Native values and principles driven.
c. The wisdom of elders and Native ways of knowing.
d. Customer Control; service industry model.
e. Asset based thinking.
2. The SCF Story at ANMC:
a. Complete system redesign on Native values.
b. Decrease in emergency room and urgent care over 40%.
c. Decrease specialty care by about 50%.
d. Decrease in primary care visits by 20%.
e. Decrease in admissions and days by 20%.
f. Improved health outcomes; patient and staff satisfaction indicators.
The Vice President provided the ACMV with a concept; on the surface
might appear to be totally new but historically may have been the modality in
other parts of the Continent. This was a very refreshing concept which tended to
put less credence on the technological world and much more on the family and
cultural environment.
3. Real Issues:
a. Understanding power and control — where decisions are REALLY
made — in the home, work, and community.
b. Understand all we can really hope for is to influence behavior.
c. Done by walking alongside in trusting relationship — no barriers,
teaching, coaching, encouraging.
4. The Ladder of Patient Activation:
a. Self Efficacy
- Level of Patient Needs — | need to care for myself. Please walk
with me.
- Health System Responses — Foster a continuous relationship that
25
",0,0,0,0
401,"promotes partnering and independence.
b. Behavior
- Level of Patient Needs — | need to change my behavior. Please
partner with me/us to change.
- Health System Responses — Be a coach, advisor, partner.
c. Knowledge
- Level of Patient Needs — | need education. Please help me/us
(family) understand.
- Health System Responses -— Instruct patients.
d. Defect
- Level of Patient Needs — | need repair. Please fix me.
- Health System Responses — Provide a mechanical fix.

In response to a question posed by the Committee regarding the impact of
PTSD on Alaska Natives, the Vice President responded that Alaska Natives
needed more emotional and traditional counseling, full utilization and integration
of the tribal doctor in the treatment process and more importantly, a “family
warrior wellness healing approach to depression and violence.” He suggested
that grant money be allocated to non-VA programs in Alaska for mental health
programs. Reimbursement of cost for care provided Alaska Native Veterans was
severely lacking and difficult to obtain.

Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network (AFHCAN)

The Director, Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network (AFHCAN)
concluded the session with a comprehensive presentation on the Network;
access to care and impediments, and the benefits, limitations, and future of
telemedicine (tribal telemedicine). Our Committee found AFHCAN has the same
technology issues as VA.

Anchorage Vet Center

The Team Leader, Anchorage Vet Center, escorted the Committee on a
tour of the facility during which he gave a briefing on the staffing (a
multidisciplinary team consisting of a team leader, office manager, and three
counselors) and on the history of the Center.

The American Indian Readjustment Counselor discussed his functions,
responsibilities, and achievements, which include:

1. Conducting aggressive outreach to veterans and their families at

remote villages throughout Alaska by traveling along with the National
Guard during military exercises.
26
",0,0,0,0
402,"2. In 2004, he established a Veterans Traditional Talking Circle for all
veterans. Attendance has been strong and the program has been
quite successful.

The Committee examined the Vet Center’s mission, area of responsibility
and chain of command. In their mission statement, the Vet Center indicated that
“Our Vet Center mission works hard at providing a continuum of quality care that
adds value.” Their outreach program is targeted to a specific area of the state
only. It is an extremely large area and requires travel by all modes of
transportation. As noted earlier in this report, travel in Alaska can be quite
challenging and costly.

The Committee was concerned about other veterans who are not located
in the targeted outreach area. These veterans located in other rural areas (i.e.
villages, etc.) have the same entitlements to benefits, services, and care as all
others in close proximity to Anchorage. The need and requirement to advise all
veterans of their entitlements cannot be ignored or forgotten because of
distances or inability to access. Alaska needs a concerted and innovative effort
to ensure that all veterans are provided the same level of services that each and
all veterans deserve.

The Vet Centers may have done a masterful job at advising and helping
veterans but entrusting individuals with no training or license to practice, with
providing services that require training and licensing, may bring different results
to the organization than the expected or anticipated needs.

Veteran Service Organization (VSO)

The Committee met with a panel of VSO’s in Alaska. The panel included:
Alaska State Veterans Coordinator; State Commander, Veterans of Foreign
Wars; Senior Vice Commander, Veterans of Foreign Wars; Department Service
Officer; American Legion; State Commander, Military Order of the Purple Heart;
Department Service Officer, Disabled American Vets; Commander, AMVETS
Department of Alaska; and Service Officer, VFW.

After a brief introduction, each panel member gave his perspective on
health care delivery in Alaska for the minority population (i.e. Alaska Natives,
etc.) The following issues were discussed:

1. Access to VA is a major issue. Lack of roads, weather, and seasonal
subsistence living made it nearly impossible for VSO’s to outreach to
veterans. In addition, 35 U.S. Postal Officers are assisting by providing
feedback to VSO’s from veterans in these rural areas because of the
lack of VSO’s in the state.

27
",0,0,0,0
403,"2. Veteran organizations are experiencing financial difficulties, thus,
increasing the hardships for VSO’s to travel to remote areas.

3. OIF/OEF returnees are also a major concern. PTSD is very high in
villages and remote areas. Providing counseling and other healthcare
benefits to these veterans is very challenging particularly since
veterans in these areas experience hardships due to fuel, water, and
job shortages.

4. There are difficulties scheduling appointments for veterans in these
remote areas because of lack of choices for travel, weather conditions,
and seasonal subsistence living. As a result, many veterans miss
critical appointments.

5. A TVR (Tribal Veteran Representative) is needed to help with the
language and cultural barriers when Alaska Native veterans are
dealing with the VA. There was supposed to be some training through
VHA but no training to date.

6. Getting legislation passed for funding from the state is a major
challenge.

Following the VSO’s remarks, the Committee agreed that health care
delivery is a critical issue and queried the panel for more information and
concerns as provided below:

1. Vocational Rehabilitation

2. Lack of a full operational veterans’ hospital in Alaska in order to
treat cancer

3. Specialty care is not available, even in civilian hospitals.

a. Doctors in rural areas can only diagnose and then the patients are
sent to the lower 48 states for treatment.
b. The physician making the diagnosis is unable to collect any fees.

4. Concerns regarding TRICARE

VA staff members were given the opportunity to comment on the VSO
Panel’s responses. VA staff noted:

1. TRICARE was not an issue for veterans.

2. There were no contract providers in the Fairbanks area.

28
",0,0,0,0
404,"3. Purchase care and fee basis was originally not available for some
services at VA because VA did not have providers. However,
purchase care was later brought into the VA system once the services
became available.

4. There is a VA clinic located on Ft. Wainwright in Fairbanks, Alaska.

5. All missed appointments due to weather:

a. Are annotated in veteran's records as missed appointments.
b. To re-schedule another appointment, the veterans were required to
go through the Director.
c. Veterans with three no shows were automatically dropped from the
system.
d. VA has made a lot of improvements with missed appointments.

Thursday, October 26, 2006
Skagway Valdez Conference Room, Downtown Marriott Hotel, Anchorage,
AK

The purpose of the meeting with DVA Leadership was to allow the VA
staff to present issues, comments, and recommendations from a staff
perspective.
VA’s Comments

e The use of telemedicine in rural areas, such as in the State of Alaska, is
limited due to the lack of specialists required for the conduct and
evaluation of patient condition. Where telemedicine can be appropriately
used, VHA has made and continues to make great strides in its utilization,
and its benefits.

e VHA is unable to deploy psychiatrists to rural areas and villages within
the State of Alaska. VHA continues to experience a critical shortage of
psychiatrists and supporting staff. To compensate the shortage, VHA is
leaning towards utilizing the Public Health system, rather than trying to
recruit sufficient specialists to work in Alaska. The cost for recruitment
and benefits could not be borne by VHA.

e Staff acknowledged there was a general absence of cooperation between
the VSO’s and the Veterans. It recommended holding “a supermarket of
benefits fair’ between the VSO’s, VA, and the Veterans to inform all of
benefits entitled to.

e Cultural burial rights and ceremonies are held, however, the rules and
regulations of the military installation must be adhered to. There are
national standards and policies in reference to ceremonies conducted for
veterans. Gravesite services are not permitted because of safety reasons
(committal service).

e There is a lack of Alaska Natives employed at the VA Regional Office.
Applications come in from urban areas only. VARO will recommend
utilizing the VOC Rehab graduates. There is a lack of personnel to run
the program. In our recruitment efforts, we include incentive bonuses to
relocate to Alaska, and we provide opportunity to get announced
vacancies. We could utilize all forums to host interns/work study
programs. Lastly, we will recommend that Alaska Regional Office go to
IHS to provide outreach to all Alaska Natives.

3]
",0,0,0,0
407,"e Alaska Native Tribal Health Care (ANTHC) is not a federal system. The
Alaska Native veterans normally utilize the Alaska Native Medical Center.
Remarks of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
The Committee commented on the practice of hiring minorities,
emphasizing the absence of Alaska Natives, Asians or Pacific Islanders on the
senior VA staff. This appeared to be a systemic problem throughout the VA.
The hiring of minorities must become a priority within and throughout VA.
The Committee requested a follow-up in reference to the issues below:
1. Partnership opportunities with villages and corporations regarding
mental health and outreach training in offering of services
2. Outreach committee activities
3. Demographics of minority employees and their positions. Hiring of
minorities must be a priority. There are no Alaska Natives, Asians, or
Pacific Islanders on the staff. (Note: VA staff provided the data-no
further action is required. )
32
",0,0,0,0
408,"Part V Recommendations

The Committee recommends the following:

RECOMMENDATION 1: VA establish the feasibility of implementing a
cooperative agreement with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium
(ANTHC); Alaska Tribal Health System; Alaska Area Native Health Service;
Indian Health Service (IHS); Alaska Native Medical Center (ANMC); Southcentral
Foundation (SCF) to provide all services which fall within the purview of VBA and
VHA. This would include the following actions:

e VA reimburse those entities, through ANTHC, for all services rendered to
Alaska Native veterans.

e VA conduct a feasibility study to examine whether the ANTHC can provide
same services that can be offered to the general veteran population (non
Alaska Natives) which may be located in close proximity to rural areas and
villages throughout the state of Alaska.

e VA develops, coordinates, and submits all legislative initiatives for
enactment of cooperative agreements, and/or elimination/modifications of
statutes, which might impede the establishment and/or consummation of
those agreements.

e VA recognize the influence and importance of Alaska Native Elders and
that VA coordinates with and secures the approval of these Elders before
finalizing and implementing cooperative agreements.

DISCUSSION: The Committee noted during the Alaska site visit, that in many
cases in rural Alaska, the healthcare facility nearest to where veterans resided
were those operated by the Alaska Healthcare System. A review of the VISN 20
Strategic Plan reflects minor mention of actual initiatives between VA and the
Alaska Healthcare System. If Memorandum of Understandings (MOUs), support
agreements, and sharing agreements are expanded, it could alleviate some of
the access issues for non-Alaska Natives veterans allowing them to receive care
in Alaskan Health Care System facilities and Alaska Natives that are not veterans
to receive care in VA facilities on a sharing basis.
RECOMMENDATION 2: Secretary and Deputy Secretary encourage VA
leadership officials to utilize all available means (i.e. Internships, Mentoring
Programs, Executive Career Field Training Programs, Leadership VA, SES
Candidate Development Program) to promote the career development of VA
minority and female employees. The ultimate goal will be to increase the number
of VA minority group employees in leadership positions throughout the
Department.

33
",0,0,0,0
409,"DISCUSSION: During the Committee’s site visit to Los Angles in 2006, it was
noted that the VAMC leadership positions were not occupied by minority staff in
numbers that would seem representative of the community being served. The
same situation was noted in the Committee’s site visit to Alaska in the latter part
of 2006 and has been noted in previous Committee site visits. Aggregate
numbers presented during the 2007 Washington, DC meeting of the Committee
appeared to indicate that Hispanic females and white females are the only
groups needing focus due to their small numbers. However, the Committee has
consistently been concerned with a small number of minorities in Director,
Deputy Director, Associate Director, Assistant Director, Chief of Staff, Chief
Medical Officer, and Nurse Executive positions. Focus needs to be paid on the
number of minorities presently in the SES, GS 13 to GS 15, Title 38 equivalent
leadership positions, and the systems in place to ensure that individuals in the
pipeline are being prepared to assume leadership roles in numbers that will
parallel the veteran population in the future. Staff recruitment training, mentoring
and career development programs require constant diligence.

For example, the current MD 715 Report for VHA/Canteen, Table A11:
Internal Selections for Senior Level Positions (GS 13-15), reflects that white
females comprise 40% of the selectees for GS 13/14, 29% of the GS 15, and
50% of the SES. Conversely, black males comprised 3.58% of the GS 13/14,
2.91% of the GS 15, and 0% of the SES internal selections. When looking a the
future pipeline for leaders in VHA on Table A 4-1, white females were 40.15% of
the GS 7, 40.62% of the GS 9, 4.53% of the GS 11 and 39% of the GS 12
positions. Conversely, black males were 8.97% of the GS 7, 7.37% of the GS 9,
2.86% of the GS 11, and 4.43% of the GS 12 positions in VHA. In overall
numbers white females may be underrepresented. However, white females are
currently in the GS 13-15 positions and GS 7/9/11/12 developmental positions in
fairly high numbers.

RECOMMENDATION 3: VA's outreach programs are extended and/or modified
to include all means and processes to advise minority veterans of their
entitlements and the Office of National Outreach Program Coordination provides
the Committee a report reflecting actions initiated to date.

DISCUSSION: After the Committee’s site visits to Los Angeles and Long Beach
in 2006, a need for enhanced outreach efforts was identified as it was in the
Committee’s site visit to Alaska in the latter part of 2006. The VA’s responses to
the Committee’s inquiries related to outreach indicated the following:

e VA concurs, endorses, and supports the overall purpose and key
elements of the recommendation. Although most VA programs
already have an outreach component, the need for a Department
level coordination function became apparent in recent years. In
response, the Office of National Outreach Program Coordination was

34
",0,0,0,0
410,"established in the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs
(OPIA) in late 2005. This organization works closely with VA
Administrations and staff offices to coordinate and monitor major
Departmental outreach efforts meant to ensure that veterans and
their families have timely access to information regarding VA
benefits and services. This office also is responsible for the
development and implementation of national VA policies related to
outreach.

e To address the specific outreach recommendations contained in this
report, the Office of National Outreach together with the Center for
Minority Veterans (CMV) will monitor outreach to minority veterans.
CMV will analyze the results of those efforts and recommend
changes where appropriate. Through this collaboration VA will
ensure: (1) coordination with internal and external stakeholders and
veteran service organizations, and (2) utilization of culturally
appropriate venues and technologies for effective communication.

e Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) are assigned to
most VHA, VBA and NCA facilities nationwide and are another means
by which VA will address the outreach recommendations. This is a
collateral duty for the majority who serve as MVPCs. However, VA
facility directors have the authority to expand this role as needed to
better serve minority veterans in their respective areas. In addition,
each Administration has a designated MVPC Liaison in VA Central
Office. The MVPC Liaisons work closely with the CMV to coordinate
outreach efforts targeted to minority veterans and respond to
inquiries from minority veterans.

RECOMMENDATION 4: VA ensures that translation services are available in
VA facilities through either the services of employee translators or contract
services. This will ensure that “Patients’ Rights and Responsibilities” functions
normally assigned to VHA are being addressed.
DISCUSSION: Alaska has many dialects and each tribal entity may speak a
different dialect. Communication with Alaska Natives and other minority veterans
not fluent in English was extremely difficult. The Committee noticed that during
the town hall meeting, a large number of veterans could not converse in the
English language and required a friend or a family member's help to translate.
The Committee assumed that this situation may occur when the veteran visited
VA facilities or when VA staff addressed the veterans. The end results are
missed appointments, misunderstanding of diagnosis, etc.

35
",0,0,0,0
411,"RECOMMENDATION 5: The current appointment processes and procedures
contained in VHA Directive 2006-055, VHA Outpatient Scheduling Processes
and Procedures, be adhered to by the Alaska VAMC and other VHA facilities to
ensure that veterans are not penalized unfairly, and that veterans’ needs for
health care services are fully met. This could be monitored during reviews under
the current SOARS process.
DISCUSSION: Based on comments received from veterans during the Alaska
site visit, the Committee is concerned with the practice of closing appointment
schedules (automated or not) and/or the practice of not answering calls for
appointments after a given time and its impact on minority veterans in Alaska and
the lower 48 states. Alaska veterans reported the following practices:
e All missed appointments, due to weather conditions, are noted in the
veteran's records as “a missed appointment.”
e Veterans with three no shows were automatically dropped from the
system.
e To re-schedule another appointment, the veteran is required to submit a
request through the Director.
RECOMMENDATION 6: VA, under the VA’s State Cemetery Grants Program,
facilitate discussions with the government officials of the state of Alaska and
Alaska Native tribal leaders to explore the possibility of establishing additional
veterans’ cemeteries on either state or tribal lands.
DISCUSSION: Distances and travel costs are burdens on all Alaska Natives
who have contributed their share of warriors in defense of our principles. Alaska
Natives have also contributed their share to the fallen warriors. Most have found
their final resting place at the National Cemeteries in Anchorage or Fairbanks on
land donated by the State of Alaska. Alaska Natives are also self-governed and
in that context; are “members of a nation.” Current VA State Cemetery Grants
guidelines place initial and long-term financial burdens on tribal governments.
RECOMMENDATION 7: VA expeditiously complies with the VA Acting General
Counsel Opinion, Subject: WEBCIMS 372917-Collection of Veterans Ethnic and
Racial Demographic Data, dated March 2, 2007.
DISCUSSION: The General Counsel Opinion states the following in paragraph
3: 38 U.S.C., Section 544(c) requires that the annual reports of the Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans include “an assessment of the needs of
veterans who are minority group members with respect to compensation, health
care, rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and programs sponsored by the
36
",0,0,0,0
412,"Department.” In order for the Committee to capture and report this information,
VHA, VBA, and NCA must collect this information. In addition, one of the primary
purposes of the Center for Minority Veterans is to “conduct and sponsor
appropriate social and demographic research on the needs of veterans who are
minorities and the extent to which programs authorized under this meet the
needs of those veterans, without regard to any law concerning the collection of
information from the public.” 38 U.S.C., Section 317(d)(5).. The Center for
Minority Veterans’ ability to “conduct and sponsor’ research as needed to
determine minority veterans needs and the efficacy of VA programs in meeting
them also requires the participation of the three program administrations.
RECOMMENDATION 8: The Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) provides
information on their budget, employee resources, and accomplishment of their
performance measures to the Committee during the next Washington, DC
meeting.
DISCUSSION: The Committee requested this information in order to determine
the tangible support that is being provided by the Department to the Center for
Minority Veterans.
RECOMMENDATION 9: CMV consider the necessity for sponsoring a Minority
Veterans National Conference or Summit to provide outreach and veterans’
benefits and assistance information to minority veteran conference attendees
and address concerns and issues adversely affecting minority veterans.
DISCUSSION: The Committee as asked the CMV to consider the merits of
conducting a Minority Veterans National Conference or Summit after noting that
a similar meeting is conducted by the Center for Women Veterans.
RECOMMENDATION 10: VA analyze their reported VA workforce minority
employee statistics to ensure that they are consistent with the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) reporting of workforce minority employee
statistics and ensure the accuracy and sustainability of conclusions concerning
senior staff representation of VA minority workforce.
DISCUSSION: The Committee has continued to note an absence of minorities
in leadership positions during site visits to VA facilities. Briefings that have been
provided have not alleviated concerns that additional attention needs to be given
to the recruitment and career development of potential senior minority staff.
RECOMMENDATION 11: Replicate the ongoing initiative VA has with the
Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital in Fairbanks Alaska with the U. S. Army.

37
",0,0,0,0
413,"DISCUSSION: The joint venture between the VA and U. S. Air Force provides
benefits for both organizations and their patient populations. This could be use
as a best practice example. The Committee recommends that the VA and U. S.
Army determine if a similar collaboration at the Fairbanks Alaska U. S. Army
facility would have potential for similar benefits.
RECOMMENDATION 12: VA develops and implements a Tribal Veterans
Representative (TVR) program in Alaska.
DISCUSSION: Due to the expanse of the state, the lack of ample VSO support,
and the unique needs of the Alaska Native veteran population; a viable TVR
program has the potential of assisting greatly with outreach to Alaska Native
veterans and non-Alaska Native veterans living in rural and remote areas of
Alaska.
RECOMMENDATION 13: The Alaska VA Regional Office should partner with
the Indian Health Services (IHS) to provide outreach to Alaska Natives.
DISCUSSION: With its current infrastructure in Alaska, the IHS is a viable
resource to provide outreach activities to Alaska Native veterans.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Systemic issues that impact minority veterans disproportionately

In the course of its periodic site visits to VA facilities in different parts of
the country with large minority populations, the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans — hereafter referred to as the ACMV or the Committee — has identified
the almost universal presence of three specific issues that impact minority
veterans disproportionately. These are: (1) insufficient outreach to minority
veterans; (2) incomplete data on the race and ethnicity of minority veterans
served and; (3) under-representation of minorities at the upper echelons of VA
staff.

Previously, the Committee, having noted their adverse systemic severity,
highlighted these issues in its Annual Report of 1 July 2007, as well as in its
Interim Report of 6 December 2007. While the degrees to which these factors
are present obviously vary from site to site, the Committee has found them to be
consistently prevalent throughout the VA, rather than manifestations of local
conditions amenable to local remedies.

There is no question that VA has the capability and capacity to resolve
those issues. The core concern of the ACMV resides with the apparent lack of
directed effort to bring about effective resolution of those issues, which
significantly contributes to the dilution of programs towards minority veterans,
and which has been discussed in previous reports. The apparent need for direct
staff actions on recommendations, on follow up, and on monitoring responses,
may be indicative of a climate, which gives the appearance of being not
responsive to and concerned about minority issues. The net result of the
absence of directed staff action will give the unmistakable perception of
underwriting the subordination of minority issues.

Issue 1: Insufficient Outreach

The Committee notes that, by definition, minority veterans constitute a
lesser percentage of the total population of veterans being served. Accordingly,
managers tend to allocate their finite human resources on adjustable statistical
ratios in favor of sound sociological analysis. This leads to an oversight that the
level of effort required to educate minority veterans about the services available
to them, and to encourage them to seek the services, to which they are entitled,
is greater than that required for the rest of the population. The complexity of this
is profound and in reality validates the justification for the existence of this
Committee.

3
",0,0,0,0
431,"In dealing with the ever present competition for resources, managers
attempt to achieve balance by labeling and tasking the Minority Veterans
Program Coordinator (MVPC) as a collateral responsibility. That acknowledges
the requirement but does not permit anyone to dedicate the time and effort to the
task necessary to achieve the level of progress and success required.

Adequate outreach to minority veterans is a key cornerstone of a
successful program. In that context, the Committee’s position is that the only
way of achieving success is for the Secretary to direct VHA, VBA and NCA to
designate the MVPCs as full-time positions at the VAMC, VARO and MSN levels.
Issue 2: Incomplete Racial and Ethnic Data

In its site visits the Committee has been struck by the perception among
minority veterans that they are not being provided equal services by “the
system;” however, the Committee’s ability to address such perceptions continues
to be hampered by the unavailability of uniform data about the race and ethnicity
of the veteran population being served. The VA General Counsel rendered an
opinion that the VA had a requirement to gather such data, but its availability
varies substantially by geographic area, and significant disparities exist among
the three major VA administrations, and VBA will comply if directed to do so.

The Committee recommends that the Secretary establish uniform criteria
for the compilation of racial and ethnic data and that he direct that such
information be collected by VHA, VBA and NCA in order to generate useful
metrics for self-improvement.

Issue 3: Under-Representation of Minorities on Staff

The Committee notes that in general, minorities are underrepresented in
the upper levels of VA regional staffs. Many reasons are advanced for this
phenomenon, but the committee finds a regional correlation between insufficient
outreach to minority veterans and insufficient outreach to minority candidates to
fill meaningful staff positions.

There is no doubt that attaining a greater representation of minorities in
higher level positions in regional staffs would have a positive impact on the
overall racial and ethnic sensitivity of the VA staff as it serves the minority
veteran population. In order to achieve that goal, the Committee recommends
that the Secretary establish clear goals, and metrics for their achievement, to be
used as factors in the performance evaluations of the senior ranking officials in
the three VA administrations.

The members of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans were
unanimous in their opinion that the three issues raised here are central to
enhancing the perception and reality of equal service to minority veterans

4
",0,0,0,0
432,"throughout the country. The Committee believes that these issues can best be
addressed as Veterans Affairs policy matters, and to that end the Committee
strongly urges the Secretary to accept and implement these recommendations.
Committee identified twenty-two (22) recommendations:

1. Increasing and funding more full-time Minority Veterans Program
Coordinator (MVPC) positions in areas where there is a large minority veteran
population. Currently four full-time MVPC positions, out of approximately 300,
are funded.

2. The ACMV recommends that the Secretary direct VHA, VBA and NCA
to designate the Minority Affairs Coordinators as full time positions at the VAMC,
VARO and MSN levels; and that funding for those positions be the responsibility
and purview of each agency.

3. Improve transition processing for Reserve and National Guard
personnel returning from deployments.

4. Increase outreach, responsiveness, and formal consultation with tribal
governments and tribal leaders, particularly in the field. This issue has been the
subject of several presidential addresses:

o Richard M. Nixon, “1970 Special Message to the Congress on
Indian Affairs,”

o Ronald Reagan, “1983 Statement on Indian Policy,”

o George H.W. Bush, “1991 Statement Reaffirming the Government-
to-Government Relationship Between the Federal Government and
Indian Tribal Governments,”

o William J. Clinton, Executive Memorandum (April 1994),
“Government to Government Relations with Native American Tribal
Governments,” and Executive Order 13175 (November 2000),
“Consultation & Coordination with Indian Tribal Government,”

o George W. Bush, Executive Memorandum (September 2004),
“Government-to-Government Relationship with Tribal
Governments.”

5. Creating awareness of policy on immigrant veterans’ benefits and
helping to fast track them into citizenship, where appropriate.

6. Support Alaska Natives and Native Americans veterans’ and their
families’ needs for burial at homeland locations.

7. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary mandate that all VA leadership
officials’ performance be evaluated on their implementation of programs
designed to reflect their total commitment to increasing the number and mix of

5
",0,0,0,0
433,"minorities at the senior staff level. Concurrently, that performance bonuses
be linked to VA leadership officials’ successes in having the work force mirror
the population being served and that VA leaders be encouraged to reflect in
their performance plans active programs that promote employee diversity.

8. In order to improve and achieve the representation of minorities on
senior staff level, the ACMV recommends that the Secretary establish clear
goals, and metrics for their achievement, to be used as factors in the
performance evaluations of senior ranking officials in the three VA
administrations.

9. The Secretary and Deputy Secretary mandate VA leadership officials
to utilize all available means — Internships, Mentoring Program, Executive
Career Fields Training Program, Leadership VA, SES Candidate
Development Program — to promote the career development of VA
employees. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of VA minority group
employees in leadership positions throughout the VA.

10. VA establish a tracking system for all programs — Internships,
Mentoring Program, Executive Career Fields Training Program, Leadership
VA, SES Candidate Development Program — to identify total number and mix
of candidates; and that such data includes the number of minorities, which
are within the purview of the ACMV.

11. VA's internal and advisory committees should include minority
members — of equal rank and stature as other members — reflective of the
veteran population being served.

12. VA establish and monitor intensive training program for Senior VA
leaders, managers, and their staff, on cultural diversities and language
competencies within the veteran population being served.

13. VA employs or trains personnel to be conversant in the predominant
language or dialect within its sphere of influence and/or operation in order to
assure the highest level of customer service.

14. That the VA analyze its reported VA workforce minority employee
statistics to ensure that they are consistent with the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) reporting of workforce minority employee statistics, to
insure that accurate conclusions concerning VA minority workforce
representation can be drawn from the reported VA workforce minority
employee statistics.

15. The Secretary directs VHA, VBA, and NCA to collect demographic
data throughout the VA, in accordance, with the VA Acting General Counsel
Opinion, Subject: WebCIMS 372917 — Collection of Veterans Ethnic and

6
",0,0,0,0
434,"Racial Demographic Data, dated March 2, 2007, and inform the ACMV, on
the status of the demographic data collection, by the next ACMV meeting in
Washington, DC.

16. The ACMV recommends that the Secretary establish uniform criteria
for the compilation of racial and ethnic data and that he direct that such
information be collected by VHA, VBA and NCA in order to generate useful
metrics for self-improvement.

17. That the Department of Veterans Affairs expeditiously implements the
VA Acting General Counsel Opinion (Opinion), dated March 2, 2007, which
requires the VA to collect ethnic and racial demographic data, from the
veteran population that it serves, by voluntary self-identification.

18. VHA provide information that reflects if minority veterans are identified
with having PTSD or other diagnoses in percentages proportional to their
military population.

19. VHA establish joint venture with DOD and academia to establish work
centers of excellence for mental health issues addressed by the ACMV.

20. VA shall incorporate relevant ACMV recommendations into the VA-
wide Strategic Plan.

21. That the Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) provide information, on
the CMV budget, employee resources and accomplishment of CMV
performance measures to the ACMV, during the ACMV annual meeting, in
Washington, DC.

22. That the Center for Minority Veterans consider the necessity for
sponsoring a Minority Veterans National Conference or Summit to provide
outreach and veterans’ benefits and assistance information to minority
veteran conference attendees, and address concerns and issues adversely
affecting minority veterans.

MEETING
The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
November 5-8, 2007
Arlington, Virginia

Background
On November 5 - 8, 2007, the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
met in Arlington, Virginia. The purpose of this meeting was to address the needs
of minority veterans served by the VA.
As the ACMV prepares for its 2008 agenda, we are sensitive to the events and
timelines, which may dominate the calendar during 2008. Therefore, elected to
provide an interim report, which summarizes five major issues — Outreach,
Diversity, Services, Mental Health to minority veterans, and Strategic Plan — and
outlines our recommendations for each issue.
Issues and ensuing recommendations tn this report are similar to those
recommendations in the Committee’s 2007 report.
l. Outreach
The Indian Health Service’s presentation was very informative and gave the
ACMV an in-depth look at the issues facing Native Americans and Alaska
Natives. The challenge of providing services to a rural and isolated veteran
population extends beyond the boundaries of Native Americans and Alaska
Natives; it affects all veterans living in rural and isolated areas of the Continental
United States, and its territories. We recognize and we compliment the
Department for its strides in identifying and implementing systems and programs
for rural and isolated areas; yet, challenges continue to affect that minority
veteran population.
Information presented to the Committee on issues concerning Homeless
Veterans, Women Veterans, OEF/OIF, Faith Based Initiatives, and VSOs were
very informative. The question and answers portion of each presentation gave us
the opportunity to better assess and determine where recommendations need to
be focused in order to meet the needs of minority veterans.
Issues concerning VA Cemeteries show a need for diversity outreach in locations
such as: Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands as well as Native
American sites; which serve minority veterans. Additionally, there is no
demographical information for identifying minority veterans who are buried at VA
Cemeteries.

8
",0,0,0,0
436,"ll. Diversity
The ACMV appreciates the Department’s support of diversity, not only at the
senior staff level, but at all levels. The ACMV fully endorses the Department's
“goal to have the work force reflect the population being served.” However, the
lack of diversity in the work force continues to be systemic throughout VA,
particularly at the Executive level — GS 13, 14, 15, and SES. Most rationale
centers on “inability to attract and recruit minority personnel; non-availability of
qualified minority personnel within an area of operation, etc.” This issue has
been addressed in past ACMV reports, and as recently as July 2007 with
the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, Subcommittee on Health. Yet,
there seems to be no impetus to change or improve the system.
(NOTE: During the ACMV meeting in Arlington, VA, November 5 — 8, 2007 the
Office of Diversity Management and EEO Administration, VA, presented data to
convey the notion of no real problem with diversity. The ACMV did ask for
specific minority data and looks forward to receiving that data and the analysis of
the data.)
lil. Services
Data collection: Data collection on minority veterans was not standardized
throughout VA. The ACMV noted that demographic information on minority
veterans was not collected in VBA and NCA. In its March 2, 2007 report
WebCIMS 372917 — Collection of Veterans Ethnic and Racial Demographic
Data, the VA’s Acting General Counsel issued its opinion and concluded that the
collection of demographic data on minorities did not violate any statutes and,
therefore, can and should be done.
During their presentations to the ACMV, the Under-Secretaries for VBA and NCA
agreed to put into place the processes to collect demographic data on minority
veterans if so directed by the Secretary.
IV. Mental Health
Mental Health — PTSD, Suicide, TBI, and MST presentations. During this
particular presentation the Committee was informed that “PTSD, in general, is
not an automatic consequence of trauma. All individuals experience trauma at
some point in their lives, but a small proportion develop PTSD. However, in the
context of combat trauma and repeated, prolonged exposure to trauma, PTSD is
a significant possibility and concern.” The ACMV is concerned that minority
veterans are hesitant to request treatment for PTSD due to the stigma attached
with receiving mental health services. Minority veterans often express concern
with the possible impact a mental health diagnosis (such as PTSD) may have on
future employment. The ACMV is concerned that PTSD among minority
veterans may be under diagnosed.

In coordination with the Secretary or Deputy Secretary designated VA staff and
office, the ACMV will identify issues which are relevant for all minority veterans,
including women, and submit those issues for incorporation in the VA-wide
Strategic Plan.

SITE VISITS
The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
North Carolina — Fayetteville, Salisbury, Winston-Salem — Site Visits
March 31 — April 3, 2008
INTRODUCTION

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans’ (ACMV) responsibilities
includes advising the Secretary and Congress on the administration of VA
benefits and services to and for minority veterans. The Committee conducts site
visits, conducts town hall meetings, meets with VA officials and Veterans to
prescribe and insure that accurate and meaningful recommendations are set
forth each year in its annual report to maximize the quality of services to minority
veterans.

While the primary purposes were to look at outreach programs and
services extended to minority veterans in light of cultural sensitivity and
frequency, quality and timeliness of services provided to Veterans, the
Committee was exposed to a range of issues, which affected all veterans. The
continued appearance of systemic issues and problems noted within the North
Carolina VA facilities, and other VA facilities was of concern to the Committee.
Those issues and problems have been noted in earlier Committee reports on its
visits to VA facilities.

During March 31 — April 3, 2008, the Committee conducted site visits at
Fayetteville VA Medical Center, Salisbury National Cemetery, and Winston-
Salem Regional Office. The Committee also met with a panel representing the
Veterans Services Organizations (VSO) located in and around the Fayetteville
area. The Committee held two town hall meetings with veterans in the
Fayetteville area and in the Winston-Salem community. The North Carolina Site
Visit Agenda is located in Appendix B.

The highlights of the Committee’s activities included their visit and tour of
the Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, N.C., and their visit with the
Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. The Committee was invited to a meeting with
Tribal Leaders and veterans, and was hosted by the Tribal Chairman at his
residence. The Committee expresses its deepest gratitude to the Chairman, Mr.
Jimmy Goins, Lumbee Tribe, Tribal Leaders and veterans for their hospitality and
graciousness during the visit.

A. SYSTEMIC ISSUES IMPACTING ON MINORITY VETERANS

The members of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans are

unanimous in their opinion that the three issues raised here are central to

",0,0,0,0
439,"enhancing the perception and reality of equal service to minority veterans
throughout the country. We believe that these issues can best be addressed as
Veterans Administration policy matters, and to that end we strongly urge the
Secretary to accept and implement these recommendations.
ISSUE 1: Under — Representation of Minorities on Staff
The Committee notes that in general, minorities are under-represented in
the upper echelons of VA regional staff offices. Many reasons are advanced for
this phenomenon but the Committee finds a regional correlation between
insufficient outreach to minority veterans and insufficient outreach to minority
candidates to fill meaningful staff positions. There is no doubt that attaining a
greater representation of minorities in higher level positions in regional staff
offices would have a positive impact on the overall racial and ethnic sensitivity of
the VA staff as they serve the minority veteran population.
VBA:
A. Winston-Salem Regional Office
The Committee’s visit at the Regional Office sustained its observation on
the absence of minorities, excluding white females, at the leadership level.
It became clear during the Regional Office’s presentation that this was not
an area of concern. Of note, during the exit brief with the Committee,
VA Regional Office staff agreed with the Committee’s observations and
“promised” to increase the recruitment and hiring of minorities for positions
at the leadership level.
The Committee raised issues with the timeline shown for processing
disability applications. Data from the Regional Office showed an average
of about 137 days from the time the application is received to its’
completion. When queried on the availability of individual's health
records, the Regional Office stated that, on average, it took
approximately 137 days to obtain the records from DoD and begin the
evaluation process on veteran’s application for disability benefits. This
assertion would, in effect, suggest that processing an application for
disability benefits takes an average of 280 days, from beginning to “end,”
rather than 137 days.
The Regional Office attributed the length of time to obtain medical records
from the Department of Defense (DoD) and opined that DoD was not
responsive to requests for those records. The Committee concluded that,
if DoD is the cause of the delay, the issue should be raised at the Joint
Committee meetings between the Secretaries of Defense and of Veterans
Affairs.

B. Fayetteville VA Medical Center

The Committee congratulates Mr. Bruce Triplett, Director of the
Fayetteville VA Medical Center (VAMC) for his sensitivities to minority
issues and for insuring that minorities were prevalent at and within the
executive level. Although the Director's programs were quite notable,
there were pockets where the absence of minority veterans was
noticeable. For example, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans were
not represented in Senior Management positions.
Similarly, Native Americans were not represented at the senior staff level:
yet six of the seven employed, occupied “lower level” positions, which did
not afford them the opportunity to compete for higher positions. This was
exacerbated by the perceived reluctance to interview and hire qualified
Native Americans. When advised of those situations, the Director
promised to take immediate action to remedy those issues, wherever
possible.

NCA:

C. Salisbury National Cemetery

Mr. Gregory Whitney, Director, Director of the Salisbury National
Cemetery, provided the Committee an excellent presentation of his role
and responsibilities. His management of all activities within his purview
was noteworthy. The Committee noted his strides to minimize the
emotional stress, and in some situations, relieved family members of the
stress that accompanies the myriad of paperwork and activities required
for burial. Several letters were testimonies to the Director’s sensitivity,
administrative prowess, and his understanding of the pain, which
accompanies the loss of a loved one. Of significance was the
decorum and the military courtesy extended to family members and
“guests” at the grave site. A VSO bugler played taps and honored each
passing veteran with a moving testimonial rendered by a VA cemetery
trained volunteer.
The Salisbury National Cemetery was a shining example for honoring our
warriors and our Veteran warriors.

ISSUE 2: Incomplete Racial and Ethnic Data
During its site visits, the Committee has been struck by the perception

among minority veterans that they are not being provided equal services by “the

system;” however, the Committee’s ability to address such perceptions continues

13
",0,0,0,0
441,"to be hampered by the unavailability of uniform data about the race and ethnicity
of the veteran population being served. The Committee understands that the VA
General Counsel rendered an opinion that the VA had a requirement to gather
such data. Yet, its availability varied substantially by geographic area, and
significant disparities existed among the three major VA administrations, with
VBA being the most resistant to the gathering of the data.
VBA:
A. Winston — Salem Regional Office
The Regional Office does not collect racial and ethnic data. During the
meeting in Washington, DC, November 5 — 8, 2007, the Committee
recommended that “The Secretary directs VHA, VBA, and NCA to
collect demographic data throughout the VA, in accordance, with the
VA Acting General Counsel Opinion, Subject: WebCIMS 372917 —
Collection of Veterans Ethnic and Racial Demographic Data, dated
March 2, 2007, and report back to the ACMV, on the status of the
demographic data collection, at the next ACMV meeting in the
National Capital Region (NCR).
VHA:
B. Fayetteville VA Medical Center
Improper classification of Native Americans — Native Americans, who
reported for care at the VAMC in Fayetteville, were improperly classified.
Review of data by members of the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and
reports from Native American veterans sustained that those veterans were
classified as Caucasians, and not as Native Americans. This improper
classification and reporting denies Native Americans their place in our
society and is contrary to statutes, policies and regulations governing
the classification and reporting of Native Americans, and of minority
veterans. Note: VHA has committed to correcting these errors
NCA:
C. Salisbury National Cemetery
The Director acknowledged the need for such data and agreed to put in
place processes to collect that data.
ISSUE 3: Insufficient Outreach
The Committee recognizes that, by definition, minority veterans constitute
a minority of the total population of veterans being served, and acknowledges
14
",0,0,0,0
442,"that managers will tend to allocate their finite human resources where the greater
return is perceived to exist. Therein lays the rub, because the level of effort
required to educate minority veterans about the services available to them, and
to encourage them to seek the services to which they are entitled, is greater than
that required for the rest of the population. The reasons for this are complex and
will not be developed here, but that reality is the justification for the existence of
this Committee.

Left to their own devices, many managers attempt to balance the
competing demands for their human resources by making the Minority Veterans
Program Coordinator (MVPC) a collateral responsibility. That acknowledges the
requirement but does not permit anyone to dedicate the time to the task
necessary to achieve the level of progress required.

In this context, adequate outreach to minority veterans is the cornerstone
of success. The Committee is convinced that the only way of achieving it is for
the Secretary to direct VHA, VBA and NCA to designate the MVPC as full time
positions at the VAMC, VARO and MSN levels.

VBA:
A. Winston — Salem Regional Office

Outreach at all activities was a collateral duty, and not a full-time position.

The Regional Office (RO) stated that it had a lack of black women in

leadership positions, and that its biggest concerns were Latino women and

men. The Committee was unable to substantiate efforts to target and
recruit shortfalls in minority staffing.

The Committee acknowledged that the Regional Office had conducted four

job fairs at local universities and Fort Bragg, and that its labor force

(Relative Civilian Labor Force) favorably compared with the labor force in

Greensboro/Winston Salem/High Point area. The RO staff admitted to

having no active outreach program to attract, recruit or train American

Indians or Latino candidates for its Management Program.

The Committee was impressed with the performance of Ms. Sharon Bultler-

Norwood, the MVPC at Winston — Salem Regional Office. Her program

and efforts were splendid. Her focus was the veteran, and she was doing

e Mental health.

e Denying access to VAMC. The widow of a Lumbee Tribe
Veteran related how her husband, a Vietnam veteran in the
Lumberton Hospital, was denied admission at the

2. Winston-Salem Marriott, Hearn Grand Ballroom

The Committee held a Town Hall meeting with veterans on Wednesday,

April 2, 2008, from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. At the Regional Office, in

Winston-Salem, the limited number of veterans in attendance suggested a

tentative and ineffective outreach program to advertise the sessions with

the veteran population. The number of veterans in attendance did not
exceed six. Of concern was that the numbers of veterans in the same
building complex were unaware of the town hall session.

denied his claim for dependency for child even though he is
paying child support.

e A Navy veteran, who has worked at the VA for six months, had
a shaving profile in the military but was denied disability for a

On Monday, March 31, 2008, the Committee met with a panel of Veterans
Services Organizations (VSO’s) at the Fayetteville VAMC. On Tuesday morning,
April 1, the Committee met with the commander and designated staff of Womack
Army Medical Center and had the opportunity to tour the medical facility. In the
afternoon, the Committee met with Tribal members of the Lumbee Tribe of North
Carolina located in Pembroke, North Carolina.

1. Panel of Veterans Services Organizations (VSQ’s):

The Committee met with Mr. Wally Johnson, Adjutant Executive Officer of
Disabled American Veterans (DAV), representing the VSO’s in the Fayetteville,
North Carolina, area of operation. The DAV’s goal is to build better alliance for
our Nation’s veterans and their families. The DAV consisted of disabled
American men and women veterans. Its membership was approximately 1.3
million veterans.

2. Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina:

The Committee’s visit and tour of Womack Army Medical Center was
informative and emotional. The Committee was impressed by the dedication of
all personnel it met during the visit. The Committee extends its gratitude to all
staff and to injured warriors for a memorable experience.

Colonel Walton, Commander, presented a very comprehensive brief on
the facility. Womack Army Medical Center, Fort Bragg, North Carolina, is the
largest Medical Center within the Army Medical Department, with approximately
3000 employees. Under BRAC, Womack Army Medical Center will assume
responsibilities for the Health Clinic at Pope Air Force Base.

Lieutenant Colonel Jay Thornton, Commander, Warrior Transition Battalion,
provided the Committee a historical perspective on the activation, organization
and mission of the Battalion.

3. Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina, Pemberton, North Carolina

The highlight of the Committee’s activities was its visit with the Lumbee
Tribe of North Carolina. The Committee held a meeting with the Tribal Chairman
and various members of the Tribe. After the meeting, the Committee attended
an event sponsored by the Lumbee Warriors Association, and which was hosted
by the Tribal Chairman at his residence. The Committee expresses its deep
gratitude to the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina for its hospitality, its
graciousness, and the events. The Committee also extends its deepest gratitude
to the Tribal Chairman and Mrs. Goins for their hospitality, the unique

B. Veterans Issues

In general, issues address the following areas:

e Improper classification of Native Americans. Native Americans,
who reported for care at the VAMC in Fayetteville, were
improperly classified. Review of data by members of the
Lumbee Tribe and reports from Native American veterans
sustained that those veterans were classified as Caucasians,
and not as Native Americans. This improper classification and
reporting denies Native Americans its place in our society and is
contrary to statutes, policies and regulations governing the
classification and reporting of Native Americans, and of minority
veterans.

e There was a sensing that if this situation existed in North
Carolina, it may also be prevalent at other VA facilities. VA
must insure that Native Americans are properly classified and
reported, and that data on minority veterans is consistent with
statutes, policies and regulations.

1. Holiday Inn I-95 Conference Room Section Ill, Fayetteville, NC
The ACMV met with key VA staff on April 3, 2008, at the Fayetteville
Holiday Inn I-95 Conference Room Section Ill. The purpose of the meeting
was to allow the VA staff to present issues, comments, and recommendations
from a staff perspective.
A. Remarks of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans:
(1) General
e Most striking was the tenor of Town Hall meeting, Fayetteville, NC.
Veterans’ presence was striking and showed great determination
on the part of the VAMC to encourage maximum attendance.
e There were several VHA issues, which were, for the most part,
handled during the meeting
e The majority of issues seem to target VBA and its processes.
(2) Outreach
e Hiring/Staffing diversity/goals:
o Connect with minority Veterans, and recognize
percentage of efforts vis a vis demographics, which is the
ACMV’s charter.
o Involve VSO’s, churches, community and tribal leaders.
o Outreach cannot be done on a part-time basis.

(3) | ACMV is concerned about the unavailability of valid racial/ethnic
data for useful metrics/self-evaluation, as required by the VA
General Counsel opinion.

(4) | Applauded the expended use of telemedicine and other diagnostic
“tests” to improve services provided beneficiaries.

(5) | Applauded the cooperation and working relationship between
theVAMC and Womack Army Medical Center. Applauded resource
sharing agreements with Womack, but questioned reimbursement
practices between VA and DOD. VHA staff's comments suggested
that VA can, indeed, reimburse DOD.

22
",0,0,0,0
450,"(6) Took note of the increased functionality of electronic health records.
Inquired about the possibility of achieving electronic transfer of
what VA needs from DOD, as Veterans flow into VA system.

(7) Questioned the practice of hiring Veterans at the VAMC,
Fayetteville, and the Regional Office, Winston-Salem, which, at
both locations, did not appear to be followed. The hiring of
Veterans was a mandatory edict for all federal agencies.

(8) Personnel accountability — supervisors, subordinates — did not
appear to be stringent. Comments suggested that a mid-year
performance review was conducted; however, there was minimal
evidence — derived from staffs comments — that supervisors and
subordinates were being held accountable for and in job
performance.

(9) Applauded the Director, VAMC, in his quest to have a diverse staff
at all levels of the organization. Recommended that effort be
directed at hiring Native Americans. The Director committed to do
that.

(10) Questioned the requirement for a “V” device on Air Medal, before
accepting Veteran’s claims of having participated in combat, and
therefore eligible for benefits. This issue was in response to a
Veteran's claim that he had been awarded 9 Air Medals, without a
“V” device, which disqualified his application for benefits.

The ACMV perceived, and VBA’s staff comments suggested, that
the Regional Office staff focused on the most demanding
interpretations of the rules (CFR) to adjudicate Veteran’s claims.
The ACMV held the opinion that VBA/RO’s focus should be on
helping the Veteran make his/her case.

(11) Applauded the MPVC — Ms. Sharon Norwood — for her superb
efforts in fulfilling her duties. Ms. Norwood was a part-time MPVC,
which required her to spend an inordinate amount of personal time
to establish an effective and far-reaching program. Recommended
that the RO’s MPVC be designated as full-time. RO’s staff
indicated that they will endeavor to do so.

(12) Applauded the Director, National Cemetery, in his quest to have a
fully diverse staff, and in his efforts to manage the emotional
trauma felt by parents, loved ones. Suggested that he provide a
name and direct phone number, rather than the 800 number, to
next-of-kins, when they have the need to contact VBA counselors.

DOD for seamless transition of military to VA.
o The VISN does not tolerate absence of courtesy, and
needs more customer service orientation.
o Hiring practices must be improved.
o MPVC is a part-time position at VISN level.

e The Director, Fayetteville VAMC, commented that:

o Space was an issue at the VAMC.

o CBOC was programmed to support Veterans of the Lumbee
Tribe, and other Veterans located in the area.

o There were immediate challenges for OEF/OIF; but felt
confident that those challenges could be resolved.

o He was proud of the make-up of his staff and subordinates,
reflecting a great mix of personnel, and of diversity at the
VAMC. He recognized the need to hire a highly-qualified
Native American counselor.

o He was sensitive to the make-up of the surrounding
communities, and would take a hard look at cultural
competency of the VAMC staff.

o There was excellent collaboration and relationship with
Womack Army Medical Center.

e Ms. Kimberley Albert represented the Acting Director and
commented that:

o Diversity may be an issue at the RO.

o MPVC is acollateral duty. However, RO will endeavor to
promote to full-time status, using RO’s resources.

o Was disappointed with the attendance at the Town Hall
meeting, and agreed that the RO did not endeavor to
publicize the meeting to Veterans in and around the area.

o Indicated that timely receipt of medical records from DOD
was a major issue. On average, DOD forwards medical
records 137 days after submission of the VBA request.
The ACMV noted that, with an average processing time —
about 137 days — of a Veteran’s initial application for
benefits, almost 280 days will have elapsed before the
Veteran is advised of the status of his/her application.
The ACMV questioned the timely processing of a Veteran’s
application for benefits.

o ROwill provide all data and information requested by the
ACMV.

453,"PART VI. RECOMMENDATIONS AND VA RESPONSES

The Committee recommends the following:

Recommendation 1: Promote culturally and geographically relevant outreach
programs and efforts throughout the VA by increasing and funding more full-time
Minority Veterans Program Coordinator (MVPC) positions in areas where there is
a large minority veteran population. Currently four full-time MVPC positions, out
of approximately 300, are funded.

VA Response: Concur In Principle

Veteran Benefits Administration has MVPCs assigned to VA Regional Offices
(VARO). In October 2007, the Center for Minority Veterans implemented the
electronic MVPC Quarterly Report. This report was designed to track ongoing
outreach activities in VA that improve minority veterans’ awareness and access
to VA services. In addition, the MVPCs must develop an operation plan of their
strategies and goals to:

(1) address access and participation of minority veterans in VA
programs;

(2) train VA employees focusing on sensitivity to the needs of
minority veterans;

(3) identify gaps in transition assistance for all service members
and veterans;

(4) meet with facility leadership to inform and discuss trends o
patterns, correct deficiencies, and address the concerns/issues
related to minority veterans.

lf a need is demonstrated, it will be assessed by local management.

National Cemetery Administration (NCA) has 77 MVPCs system-wide, with a
majority of them serving concurrently as the Director of the national cemetery.
MVPCs are also partnering with local medical centers and regional offices. They
are steadily increasing their outreach activities in their respective regions.
Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has MVPCs at each of its 59 regional
offices. Local management works with the MVPCs regarding time needed to
attend minority veteran events and/or assist minority veterans. Currently, the
need for a full-time MVPC position in VBA has not been demonstrated. NCA will
designate one MVPC as a full-time position in the VACO Office of Field
Programs.
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has MVPCs throughout its medical
facilities. Four of these individuals are in full-time positions. 10N will review the
need to have full-time MPVCs.

26
",0,0,0,0
454,"As stated by the ACMV the complexity of this problem is profound nevertheless
not resolvable. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a very proactive
approach to its outreach services.
In 2006, the Department unveiled the Community Prosperity Program (CPP).
The chief purpose of CPP is for VA to work directly at the local community level
and create a framework for affinity organizations, veterans service organizations,
federal, state, and local governments, institutions of higher education, and the
private sector to collaborate on mutually supportive programs, education,
employment, health for American’s veterans and dependents.
In addition to CPP, VA continues to support aggressively the minority community
monthly national job fairs and health expos supporting veterans and local
community needs. The key during all these events are presentations on the VA’s
current information regarding veteran benefits and health services.
The Department continues to work with minority groups to assess activities that
will improve VA’s delivery service through heightening outreach and awareness
to the local minority community and veteran interest. VA’s appraisal of these
national events is that they provide excellent outsources for field facilities on the
latest programs and activities supporting local communities and specifically, our
Nation’s veterans.
The Department continues to explore ways to reach out and expand its
awareness and outreach efforts supporting its homeless, PTSD, new Gl Bill,
Vocational Rehab Services, to name a few.
Recommendation 2: The ACMV recommends that the Secretary direct VHA,
VBA and NCA to designate the Minority Veteran Program Coordinators as full
time positions at the VAMC, VARO and MSN levels; and that funding for those
positions be the responsibility and purview of each agency.
VA Response: See response for Recommendation 1 above.
Recommendation 3: Improve transition processing for Reserve and National
Guard personnel returning from deployments.
VA Response: Concur In Principle.
One of VBA’s largest areas of outreach is to Reserve and National Guard
personnel. VBA has assisted in the national training of Transition Assistance
Advisors for the National Guard and regional offices have developed local
memorandums of understanding (MOU) with National Guard units. VBA is working
on a national MOU with the Army Reserve. In the near future, VBA will begin
working on national MOUs with other branches of the Reserve forces.

27
",0,0,0,0
455,"The VHA Office of Outreach has begun several initiatives to ensure
Guard/Reserve members separating from active duty receive information about
VA and encourage enrollment for health care. These include:
o Letters are sent to those on the Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) roster to
encourage enrollment into VA health care.
o VA participates in Post Deployment Health Readjustment Assessment
(PDHRA) events.
o VA staff participates in reintegration programs.
o VA staff continues collaboration with the National Guard/VA Transition
Assistance Advisors who are VA trained outreach coordinators in each
State.
o VA staff collaborates with Warriors in Transition and those injured in
Warrior Transition Units.
o VA staff conducts town hall meetings and training conferences with
Guard/Reserve Family Programs.
o VA staff links Army and Marine Point of Contacts (POC) with OEF/OIF
Program Managers at VA medical center and VISNs.
o Future initiative: Geo-mapping of home of record for those OEF/OIF
veterans living in rural areas to identify those in need of services.
There are many individuals returning from current deployments who are unaware
of VA services and benefits and how to access these services. Locating those
living in rural areas will allow VA to provide health care services or authorize care
through civilian health care resources.
Recommendation 4: Increase outreach, responsiveness, and formal
consultation with tribal governments and tribal leaders, particularly in the field.
This issue has been the subject of several presidential addresses:

o Richard M. Nixon, “1970 Special Message to the Congress on
Indian Affairs,”

o Ronald Reagan, “1983 Statement on Indian Policy,”

o George H.W. Bush, “1991 Statement Reaffirming the Government-
to-Government Relationship Between the Federal Government and
Indian Tribal Governments,”

o William J. Clinton, Executive Memorandum (April 1994),
“Government to Government Relations with Native American Tribal
Governments,” and Executive Order 13175 (November 2000),
“Consultation & Coordination with Indian Tribal Government,”

o George W. Bush, Executive Memorandum (September 2004),

staff serves as advisors to the Secretary on policy and program initiatives
impacting American Indian/Alaska Native veterans’ issues.
The NCA Central Office MVPC Liaison attended the Administration on Aging:
Office for American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian Programs
conference to discuss various issues/concerns affecting the American Indian,
Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian communities. NCA along with VHA and
VBA provided information at the conference on the various services and benefits
that VA provides. Each administration also participated in a Q&A session and
conducted briefings. VA will be participating in this year’s conference as well.
VBA outreach coordinators will continue to participate in various events to reach
Native American veterans such as VA benefits briefings on reservations and
meetings with local Native American groups. VHA monitors and encourages
Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) to support outreach activities and
clinical interventions to improve access for Native Americans (NA) and Alaska
Natives to VA medical services. The following lists specific activities reported for
fiscal year (FY) 2007, 4th Quarter.

The Office of Rural Health (ORH) acknowledges the challenge of providing
services to rural and highly rural veteran populations, including Native Americans
and Alaska Natives. The ORH is working specifically to coordinate delivery of
services with VHA program offices and field units to address these needs and to
ensure the needs of rural veterans are being considered as program
development and implementation takes place. The role of the ORH is to provide
policy, guidance, and oversight within VHA to enhance the delivery of care by
creating greater access, engaging In research, promulgating best practices and
developing sound and effective policies to support the unique needs of enrolled
veterans residing in geographically rural areas.
Also, since 2003, VA and the Department of Health and Human Service's Indian
Health Service have worked together under a formal agreement that encourages
cooperation and resource sharing between the two agencies. Under the
agreement, VA and IHS work to improve health care for rural American Indian
and Alaska Native Veterans, including those who live in rural and very rural
areas.

° The Alaska VA Healthcare System has conducted a mailing on VA
benefits, including health care, to minority veterans. As it has done for the
last 5 years, in October the system will have an outreach table at the
annual Alaska Federation of Natives conference.

° The primary focus of the Alaska VA Healthcare System’s outreach was to
prepare rural communities for returning National Guard troops deployed to
Kuwait. Clinicians were part of a team making presentations in several
communities. The team attended two community “Welcome Home”
events in November — in Kenai, Alaska and Ketchikan, Alaska.

° Health care system employees conducted an outreach program for
veterans of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq on post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and a reintegration presentation in December at Manilaq
Health Corporation in Kotzebue. The VA Chaplain and the Transition
Patient Advocate traveled to Bethel on February 6, 2008 and discussed
VA services at a meeting of the Moravian Church Synod. Under an
agreement with the Alaska State Department of Military and Veterans
Affairs, outreach staff will accompany National Guard staff visiting remote
armories in Bethel, Juneau, and Nome.

° VA has current outreach activities including those administered through
VHA Program Offices and Field Units. For example, VA currently
engages in outreach to American Indian and Alaska Native veterans and
has developed the peer-based Tribal Veteran Representative Outreach
Program (TVR). This program provides outreach, peer assistance, and
information on VA benefits through representatives endorsed or
sponsored by recognized Tribal organizations. VA is proud to support this
program as it continues to grow. Last year TVR trained a group of
representatives to conduct outreach to Native Americans. Similar
programs are in place at in other parts of the VA system serving
substantial numbers of Native Americans.

The Alaska VA Healthcare System also holds community events that include

outreach to minority veterans and other veterans. It will conduct five community

forums in 2008, beginning in January. The first forum focused on helping
veterans access VA health care and benefits. Topics for future sessions include
post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and suicide prevention.

Recommendation 7: The Secretary and Deputy Secretary mandate that all VA
leadership officials’ performance be evaluated on their implementation of
programs designed to reflect their total commitment to increasing the number
and mix of minorities at the senior staff level. Concurrently, that performance
bonuses be linked to VA leadership officials’ successes in having the work force
mirror the population being served and that VA leaders be encouraged to reflect
in their performance plans active programs that promote employee diversity.

Senior Executives are evaluated on the implementation of effective affirmative
employment programs within their organizations to meet equal employment
opportunity and diversity goals, and compliance with merit system principles.
Additionally Senior Executives are accountable for ensuring diversity in executive
level committees and ensuring that qualified and high potential applicants in all
succession and workforce development initiatives reflect the diversity of the local

minorities on senior staff level, the ACMV recommends that the Secretary
establish clear goals, and metrics for their achievement, to be used as factors in
the performance evaluations of senior ranking officials in the three VA

VA Response: Please see response to Recommendation 7.
Recommendation 9: The Secretary and Deputy Secretary mandate VA
leadership officials to utilize all available means — Internships, Mentoring
Program, Executive Career Fields Training Program, Leadership VA, SES
Candidate Development Program — to promote the career development of VA
employees. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of VA minority group
employees in leadership positions throughout the VA.
VA Response: Concur
The VA Strategic Plan FY 2006-2010 contains, Objective E.1, which states-
Recruit, develop, and retain a competent, committed, and diverse workforce that
provides high-quality service to veterans and their families. A section under this
objective states that VA will “Promote workforce diversity to ensure that our
workforce reflects the veteran population we serve.”
NCA Human Resource and Education/Training has consistently provided
internship programs and career development training opportunities designed to
prepare employees presently in lower grades, GS 7 through GS 12, with the
knowledge and skills necessary to perform successfully in senior level positions,
GS 13 through GS 15. The majority of minorities that occupy the lower grades
take full advantage of NCA’s career development opportunities. NCA is on target
to provide opportunities for all employees, to include, women and minorities in
the leadership pipeline, to fill senior level positions as they become available.
NCA employees have consistently applied and have been selected for the
Leadership VA program on an annual basis and achieved successful completion.
NCA is committed to increasing the representation of groups who have lower
than expected participation.
In his annual Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Policy Statement to all VBA
employees, the former Under Secretary for Benefits, declared his personal
commitment to meet legal requirements and directives of the STET Commission.
“Experience has taught me that the uniqueness of each employee is an asset of
incalculable worth. | am firmly committed to creating an environment within VBA
that is free of discrimination, where all employees are provided with an opportunity
to develop, perform, and advance to their maximum potential without regard to
race, national origin, color, gender, age, religion, disability status, or sexual

leadership potential to prepare for future Assistant Director positions in Regional
Offices. It provides the opportunity to meet VBA's goal of improving the
opportunities for advancement of women, minorities, and persons with disabilities
in leadership roles. The ADD Program enables participants to prepare for the
Assistant Director position through classroom training, e-learning, self-
development, individual and group projects, and detailed assignments.
VBA's Leadership Enhancement and Development (LEAD) Program is
designed to enhance the leadership potential of high-performing employees in
mid-level grades. It also provides an opportunity to meet VBA's goal of
improving the opportunities for advancement of women, minorities, and
persons with disabilities in leadership roles. The LEAD Program enables
participants to develop their leadership skills through classroom training,
individual and group projects, and shadowing assignments.
The Loan Guaranty Service (LGS) offers non-supervisory LGS field employees at
the GS 9-12 levels an opportunity to participate in the Loan Guaranty Leadership
Enrichment Program. This program is designed to identify and develop a diverse
cadre of potential future leaders within the LGY program.
The Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Managerial
Enhancement Program (MEP) is designed to identify and enrich a diverse cadre
of potential future leaders within the VR&E workforce. The program is designed
for non-supervisory VR&E regional office personnel at the GS 11-12 level in the
following positions: Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor, Counseling
Psychologist, Employment Coordinator, and Management Analyst.
VBA regional office (ROs) and Central Office personnel may participate in three
internship programs. The programs include the Hispanic Association of Colleges
and Universities (HACU), Minority Access, Inc. (MAI), and the Workforce
Recruitment Program (WRP) for Disabled College Students. VBA’s primary
responsibility in these internship programs Is to ensure the development of work
plans that incorporate meaningful and challenging work assignments for interns,
and to provide high quality and consistent supervision so that the interns’ work
experiences are rewarding.

VHA has implemented system-wide measures for ensuring compliance with merit
promotion principles, affirmative employment, equal opportunity, and diversity
goals at all levels of the organization.
VHA has consistently provided career development training opportunities
designed to prepare all VA employees with knowledge and skills necessary to
perform in higher grades. These programs include the Technical Career Field

As a part of workforce and succession planning strategies, VHA continues to
provide all employees with training based on the High Performance Development

Recommendation 10: VA establish a tracking system for all programs —
Internships, Mentoring Program, Executive Career Fields Training Program,
Leadership VA, SES Candidate Development Program — to identify total number
and mix of candidates; and that such data includes the number of minorities,
which are within the purview of the ACMV.
VA Response: Concur In Principle
VHA tracks the diversity components (race and gender) for participants in the
Executive Career Field Training Program, Leadership VA, and Senior Executive
Service (SES) Candidate Development Programs. Tracking the diversity
components (race and gender) has allowed VHA to conduct program evaluations
more effectively. Through strategic planning, VHA will continue to assess the
diversity components in other career and leadership development programs and
will ensure proper strategies are formulated and deployed to reduce diversity
gaps. Efforts are underway to track diversity components for the VISN LEAD
and Graduate Healthcare Administrators Training Programs.
The VA National Database for Interns (VANDI) was implemented in July 2007 in
VHA, to track medical interns in various VA recognized programs. It also allows

The Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) requires that memberships are to
be fairly balanced in terms of the point of view represented and the functions to
be performed. The Department of Veterans Affairs follows the FACA general
guidelines. Members of VA’s advisory committees are selected based on their
individual expertise in the areas related to the respective committee functions
and diversity of membership is a consideration when determining the final
composition of board membership.

VA Response: Concur In Principle
VA Strategic Goal Two is: “Ensure a smooth transition for veterans from military
service to civilian life; the Department has the following performance measure:
Improve services through clear and consistent communications with future
veterans and their families.” VA follows OPM guidelines in the management of,
hiring, and training its employees. Language skills are only a condition for
employment when they are a critical performance factor, are part of the major
duties for the position being advertised, and are included in the specific position
description. To ensure that veterans and family members are provided essential
services, the Department ensures that translations services are made available
and has translated many documents into Spanish.
lt is VHA’s policy to provide language assistance to all individuals with limited
English proficiency (LEP) in order to have meaningful access to services. This is
in compliance with Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for
Persons with LEP, which provides for improving access to Federally-conducted
and Federally-assisted programs and activities for persons who, as a result of
national origin, are limited in their English proficiency, and eliminating to the
maximum extent possible LEP as an artificial barrier to full and meaning
participation by beneficiaries in all Federally-conducted and Federally-assisted
programs and activities.
NCA is dedicated to ensuring that its programs and services are accessible to all
persons who wish to utilize them. NCA has implemented a telephone language
interpreting service at each of the cemeteries nationwide in order to provide the
highest level of customer service to individuals with limited English proficiency. It
is NCA’s policy to provide every reasonable effort to make its programs and
services accessible to all people.

statistics, to insure that accurate conclusions concerning VA minority workforce
representation can be drawn from the reported VA workforce minority employee
statistics.

VA Response: Concur

Data Coverage and Definitions - On-board Federal employment statistics used in

this report are dated September 30, 2007. All data are produced from the U.S.

Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) Central Personnel Data File (CPDF).

The Federal Workforce (FW) referred to in this report is not the entire FW, but

rather only permanent employees in those non-postal Federal Executive Branch

agencies participating in the CPDF. This report covers workers in all pay plans
including General Schedule and Related (GSR) pay plans, Non-GSR pay plans,
blue-collar pay plans, and employees at Senior Pay levels. In the 2006 survey,
there were 865 employee records coded multiracial; these records were
excluded from the 2006 report. When prorated to the several minority groups, the
impact of exclusion was minimal. Effective with this year’s FEORP report,
employee records coded as NOT Hispanic/Latino and multiracial are included in
minority group totals. All references made to the General Schedule pay plan in
this report are to General Schedule and Related (GSR) pay plans. Only those
agencies with 500 or more permanent employees are displayed in this report.

» Senior Pay level employment includes employees in the Senior Executive
Service (SES), Senior Foreign Service, and other employees earning salaries
above grade 15, step 10 of the General Schedule, but excludes those
employees under the Executive Schedule (pay plan EX).

= Civilian Labor Force (CLF) percentages for each minority group presented in
this report are derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Annual Current
Population Survey (CPS). The CPS data cover non-institutionalized
individuals 16 years of age or older, employed or unemployed, U.S. citizens
and non-U.S. citizens.

= Relevant Civilian Labor Force (RCLF) is the Civilian Labor Force (CLF) data
that are directly comparable (or relevant) to the occupational population being
considered in the FW. For example, we would compare Black engineers
employed in the Federal workforce with Black engineers reported in the
RCLF. In this report, the RCLF varies from agency to agency because of the
differing occupational mix within each agency. The RCLF is the benchmark
used to measure individual Federal agencies’ minority representation relative
to the CLF. The RCLF is unique to each agency because it includes civilian
labor force employment only for the occupations found within each agency.
Unlike the nationwide CLF percentages, which OPM estimates annually using
the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Population Survey, the RCLF
percentages use decennial Census data, the only source of occupation data

=» Underrepresentation, as defined in 5 CFR, section 720.202, means a
situation in which the number of women or members of a minority group
within a category of civil service employment constitutes a lower percentage
of the total number of employees within the employment category than the
percentage of women or the minority group constitutes within the civilian labor
force of the United States.
= Occupational categories discussed in this report are white-collar and blue-
collar. The white-collar category contains Professional, Administrative,
Technical, Clerical or “Other” white-collar occupations. Professional
occupations typically require a baccalaureate or professional degree and,
along with Administrative occupations, are the usual sources for selections to
senior management and executive positions. Positions in Technical, Clerical,
Other, and blue-collar occupations usually are limited to lower grades with
limited opportunity for promotion to management levels. Advancement in
these occupations often depends on individual attainment of further education
or advanced skills. Employment data in this report are presented by
occupational category and grade groups to provide a more informative profile.
Recommendation 15: The Secretary directs VHA, VBA, and NCA to collect
demographic data throughout the VA, in accordance, with the VA Acting General
Counsel Opinion, Subject: WebCIMS 372917 — Collection of Veterans Ethnic
and Racial Demographic Data, dated March 2, 2007, and inform the ACMV, on
the status of the demographic data collection, by the next ACMV meeting in
Washington, DC.
VA Response: Concur in Principle
VHA collects veterans’ racial and ethnic information on a voluntary basis, and
has done so since 2002. Research on racial and ethnic disparities in health care
is a priority of VHA’s Office of Research and Development, Health Services
Research and Development Service. Current research focuses on identifying
disparities in care, understanding possible reasons for disparities and developing
interventions to reduce disparities. The Center for Health Equity Research and
Promotion, of which VA is a stakeholder, is based in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
VA General Counsel has reviewed its earlier opinion concerning the VA
responsibility to collect race and ethnicity data. The General Counsel opinion
provided on June 18, 2008 stated the following in reference to VBA and NCA:
The collection of race and ethnicity data by VBA and NCA need not be
accomplished by requesting the information from all applicants for benefits or all
beneficiaries. This information may be collected by any means designed to yield
statistically valid results, including appropriate survey instruments.

uniform criteria for the compilation of racial and ethnic data and that he direct that
such information be collected by VHA, VBA and NCA in order to generate useful
metrics for self-improvement.

VA Response:

Please see response to Recommendation 15.

Recommendation 17: That the Department of Veterans Affairs expeditiously
implements the VA Acting General Counsel Opinion (Opinion), dated March 2,
2007, which requires the VA to collect ethnic and racial demographic data, from
the veteran population that it serves, by voluntary self-identification.

VA Response: See response to Recommendation 15.

Recommendation 18: VHA provide information that reflects if minority veterans
are identified with having PTSD or other diagnoses in percentages proportional
to their military population.

VA Response: Concur In Principle

The VHA Office of Mental Health Services agrees that this is an important
question and would be willing to work with the Center for Minority Veterans on
strategies to obtain such data. VHA does not have a data source to provide this
information currently, since the field on the electronic medical record to indicate
race is often not completed and veterans cannot be required to provide this
information. Options to explore include:

° Working with the Public Health and Environmental Hazards
Strategic Health Care Group, to see whether it has accurate racial
data from the Department of Defense on OEF/OIF veterans to
examine that subset of the veteran population in relation to this
question.

° Working with the National Center for PTSD, the Mental Illness
Research Education and Clinical Centers, and the Centers of
Excellence on Mental Health and PTSD to develop pilot studies and
research proposals to address this issue.

° Considering other avenues to explore this issue, as well.

The Office of Mental Health Services does not have the authority to create a
center of excellence for mental health issues. However, the Office of Mental
Health Services, along with other components of Patient Care Services, has
been working already with the Center of Excellence being established by the
Department of Defense, with planned collaboration by VHA and by the Uniformed
Services University of Health Services. This collaboration fits well with the

Executive Summary

The 2009 Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
provides the Committee’s assessments, recommendations and supporting
rationale that addressed the three key focus areas:

- Outreach Programs

- Diversity and Inclusion

- Demographic Data Collection

Public Law 103-446 Section 510 specifies that ACMV will conduct a
minimum of two meetings per year. This year, the Committee was not able to
conduct two separate meetings. The normally scheduled Fall meeting at
Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) was cancelled due to the November 2008
Presidential Elections and the expected changes in the Veterans Affairs (VA)
administration. Instead, the Committee conducted a combined VACO meeting
and a site visit to Baltimore, Maryland on April 6 — 10, 2009. In addition, the
Committee held two Town Hall meetings, one at the DC VA Medical Center and
the other in Baltimore, to convey VA’s commitment to minority Veterans and to
listen to their issues, concerns, and recommendations.

The intent of the Committee’s sessions was to assess and determine the
effectiveness, if any, of the three key focus areas on minority Veterans. The
Committee was also exposed to a wider range of issues which have
systematically affected all Veterans, such as claims processing, women Veteran
health care issues (accessibility and safety), and homelessness (outreach and
services availability). The last two issues have been addressed extensively in
the Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans (ACHV) and Advisory Committee
on Women Veterans (ACWV) 2008 annual reports.

The Committee’s previous annual report on July 1, 2008, contained 22
recommendations. Our task was to follow up as to whether any improvements
were made by VA to enhance the availability and accessibility of services to
minority Veterans. Our meeting with VA leaders and site visits proved that some
improvements have indeed been implemented while others need further attention
and new issues have been exposed.

However, the Committee strongly recommend added emphasis be given
to the specific concerns outlined below with regards to recommendations
previously stated in the 2008 Annual Report. These include the following:

Page 3 of 56
",0,0,0,0
489,"Outreach — The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Veterans
Benefits Administration (VBA) must make a concerted effort to address the need
to fund Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) as full-time employees
in areas with a high concentration of minority Veterans. The MVPC program
facilitates making services more accessible to minority Veterans throughout the
country. The Committee found that when MVPCs performed this function as a
collateral duty, it resulted in a reduced level of services and dissemination of
outreach information to minority Veterans.

Diversity and Inclusion — The VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan
2009-2013 published on February 9, 2009, requires added emphasis from VA’s
most senior leadership. The Committee applauds Secretary Shinseki’s
commitment to strengthening and enabling diversity and inclusion by directing
the entire leadership chain to support this program in a manner consistent with
the vision and mission of the Department. We share his views that diversity and
Inclusion is not a secondary issue, but is critical to supporting VA’s mission and
purpose.

Demographic Data — In the Committee’s annual report of July 1, 2008, it
was strongly recommended that the Department formulate a plan to establish a
credible set of racial and ethnic data replete with analysis to assess and evaluate
services and programs provided to meet the increasing needs of minority
Veterans and their families. During our site visits and exchanges with Veterans,
there remains the perception among minority Veterans and their families that
they are not being provided services by VA commensurate with those provided to
majority Veterans. This perception in the field cannot be evaluated without the
aforementioned data. Secretary Peake addressed this issue in his November
2008 memo to the Committee and tasked the Veterans Benefits Administration to
provide a plan for the collection of the data. In a letter from the Chairman ACMV
to Secretary Shinseki dated April 23, 2009, the Committee requested that VBA’s
plan (for collecting race/ethnic data) be provided to the ACMV NLT May 31,
2009. To date, the Committee has not received a response from VBA.

Collaboration of Advisory Committee Reports and
Recommendations — The Committee strongly recommends that reports and
recommendations from several advisory committees, namely the Minority
Veterans, Women Veterans, and Homeless Veterans, be cross analyzed to
determine trends and needs to address the common themes reflected during our
respective scheduled meetings. The convergence of issues and
recommendations could potentially be helpful to the Department in evaluating the
effectiveness of programs given the increased funding to the Department. It
would also obviate the stove piping effect and provide a programmatic approach
to addressing the systemic challenges facing the Department.

In Part | is a list of 14 recommendations with supporting rationale. These
recommendations stemmed from discussions and information exchanges with

Page 4 of 56
",0,0,0,0
490,"VA senior executive leaders, employees, minority Veterans, families and
Veterans Service Organization representatives. The Committee strongly feels
that these recommendations will add tremendous value for the Department to
effectively address the many and varied needs of minority Veterans, and
collaboratively, with the needs of women and homeless Veterans.

We thank the Department's leaders and staff, especially the Center for
Minority Veterans, for their strong support of the Committee in making our site
visits and interaction within VA and the community possible. We also extend our
sincere appreciation to the leaders and staff at the VA sites and facilities for their
extraordinary efforts to improve services and benefits to minority Veterans.
Lastly, the Committee will remain fully committed in supporting Secretary
Shinseki’s Transformation efforts and obligations to be actively involved and
prepared to help change and meet Veterans’ needs now and in the future.
HIGHLIGHTS
Town Hall Meetings - The Town Hall meetings were very informative and gave
the Committee the opportunity to hear directly from Veterans, their families, and
Veterans Service Organizations. Issues most commonly raised were: (a)
mistreatment of Veterans and families at the VA facilities — these statements
ranged from lack of communication from VA staff to apathy in the care of
Veterans; (b) lengthy processing of claims — Veterans did not understand why
claims take so long; (c) women Veteran's health care issues — accessibility and
safety were discussed; (d) homeless Veterans — outreach is needed to reach
these Veterans who are at most risk for health issues; and (e) closing of the
Washington, D.C. Regional Office.

Site Visit at the Maryland Center for Veterans Education and Training
(MCVET) - The Committee considered this to be the model of a community
based Veterans program resourced by the local community and funded by a
multitude of sources — Federal (VA), State (Maryland), donations, and Veterans
Service Organizations (VSO). It is a “non-profit organization established in 1993
to provide homeless Veterans and other Veterans in need with comprehensive
services that will enable them to rejoin their communities as productive citizens.”
COL Charles Williams (USA, Ret) leads the facility. The establishment of a
similar program in other sites throughout the U.S. and abroad would prove
valuable to the Department's Homeless Veterans program. We strongly
recommend your staff visit this facility in the near term.
Exit Interview with Washington DC and Baltimore, MD VA Leaders - The
open discussion with VA senior leaders at this forum proved worthwhile. The
lessons learned that resulted from discussions, observations and collection of
data from the site visits, some that needed to be reiterated, were covered.
Collectively, the Committee members and VA senior leaders agreed that active
Page 5 of 56
",0,0,0,0
491,"intervention and involvement with minority Veterans’ issues and concerns will be
measured by those who are the beneficiaries of VA services. And that we must
be fully supportive of Secretary Shinseki’s vision of transforming VA into a 21*
century organization for the sake of our Veterans.

issues and/or concerns. The Committee has analyzed, discussed, and
formulated recommendations for Secretary Shinseki’s consideration to improve
benefits and services for minority Veterans and their families.
Recommendations

1. Promote culturally and geographically relevant outreach
programs and efforts throughout the VA by increasing and funding more
full-time Minority Veterans Program Coordinator (MVPC) positions in areas
where there is a large minority Veteran population.

Note: The Committee strongly recommends that it is imperative that
MVPCs attend monthly training meetings/teleconferences. The Secretary should
express his support of this recommendation in a VA-wide memorandum. Where
there are 30% or more minority Veterans in their catchment area (i.e. Los
Angeles VAMC — 44%, Chicago VAMC — 56%, Houston VAMC — 43%, New York
City VAMC — 42% and Hampton VAMC — 35%). The Committee strongly
recommends that VA leadership support the outreach initiatives reflected in the
MVPC Handbook 0801 that provides structural guidance on how to support the
MVPCs, time needed to participate on monthly teleconference calls, and funding
necessary to attend Biennial MVPC National Training Conferences.

Rationale: The Secretary's endorsement of the MVPCs is critical for the
provision of quality service and coordination to our Veterans. Currently, the
MVPC position is viewed as ""other duties as assigned,” however, this position
needs greater visibility and support from facility directors and staff. The outreach
responsibility of MVPCs is essential to achieving the goal of the VA in providing
to our service members.

The VA Maryland Health Care System in Baltimore recently briefed the
Committee during our site visit on some of the events and activities the MVPCs
are conducting to promote, inform, and educate Veterans in the local community
about the health care services available to them. They are conducting
collaborative efforts through assistance of social workers from various services to

Page 7 of 56
",0,0,0,0
493,"attend targeted outreach events and maintaining regular contact with state and
city agencies. The Maryland VAMC sponsors a monthly cable show to provide
health and wellness information to Maryland’s Veterans, their family members
and the local community. They also broadcast on local government access cable
stations throughout the state, in waiting and patient rooms through the medical
centers and on the website. These are some of the best practices the MVPCs
are doing in Baltimore, MD.

VA Response: Concur in principle. The National Cemetery
Administration (NCA) is in the process of establishing a full-time MVPC position
at Central Office in Washington, D.C. This newly established position will require
the MVPC to work collaboratively with the MVPCs at each of the cemeteries,
VAMC and Regional Offices nationwide on developing outreach initiatives. The
MVPC will assist in strengthening and developing new partnerships with minority
service organizations, Veterans Service Organizations (VSO) as well as internal
and external stakeholders within the local areas served by that facility.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has a designated Minority
Veterans Program Coordinator (MVPC) at each medical center. Each MVPC is
responsible for developing a local plan for outreach activities to minority
Veterans. In addition, each MVPC is responsible for submitting a quarterly report
for tracking and trending of outreach activity data and ethnicity data for Veterans
served in each primary service area. Medical centers have ongoing efforts to
evaluate the appointment and penetration of MVPCs areas with a high
concentration of minority Veterans to determine if sufficient outreach activities
are occurring to adequately serve the minority Veteran population. Several
medical centers have converted their MVPC positions to full-time to meet
minority Veteran populations outreach needs. These full-time MVPCs serve in
the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Seattle VAMC, Black Hills
VAMC, and Long Beach VAMC. Outreach requirements are also addressed at
VAMCs through the efforts of other medical center assets such as medical center
public affairs and marketing staff. VHA has also appointed a MVPC Liaison in
the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and
Management.

Also, the Department of Veterans Affairs Learning University (VALU)
supports the Center for Minority Veterans by planning biennial training
conferences to provide training to MVPCs across the VA system. The 10""
Biennial MVPC Training Conference was held June 1-5, 2009 in Atlanta,
Georgia. Approximately 164 MVPCs attended.

To address disparities in care that might result from cultural issues,
advisory bodies have recommended that health care organizations provide
continuing education on culturally and linguistically appropriate service delivery
for health care providers, clinical care managers and front line clerical staff with
significant responsibilities for patient interactions. Within VHA, a task force has
worked to develop cultural competency training for health care providers. The

Page 8 of 56
",0,0,0,0
494,"goals of the training are to enhance self awareness of attitudes toward people of
different racial and ethnic groups; improve care by increasing knowledge about
cultural beliefs and practices, attitude toward health care, and the burden of
various diseases in different populations served; and improves skills such as
communication. Training products are available to health care staff across VHA.
This training was developed to increase awareness of findings that both
providers of health care and consumers can bring perceptions, traditions and
patterns of communication based on cultural, racial and ethnic identity to the
clinician-patient interactions.

The Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has Minority Veterans
Program Coordinator (MVPC) positions assigned to each of its 57 regional
offices. MVPCs conduct outreach activities to improve minority Veterans’
awareness and access to VA services; train VBA employees about the needs of
minority Veterans; and meet with facility leaders to discuss trends, correct
deficiencies, and address concerns/issues related to minority Veterans. Local
managers work with the MVPCs to provide time to attend minority Veteran
events and assist minority Veterans. Currently, a need for full-time MVPC
positions in VBA has not been demonstrated.

2. Establish an enduring strategic communication plan to emphasize
the Post 9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2007; Executive Order
13360, Contracting with Service-Disabled Veterans’ Businesses; P. L. 109 -
461, the Veterans Benefits Healthcare and Information Technology Act of
2006; the Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE); the WWII Filipino Veterans
Equity Compensation Fund; and other Veteran empowerment programs
that emphasize minority Veterans.

Rationale: An effective measure of effectiveness to ensure consistency
between policy and execution at the field level is critical.

VA Response: Concur in principle. In regard to healthcare issues
included in the Veterans Benefits Healthcare and Information Technology Act of
2006, VHA has initiated communication plans in the following areas:

Section 203, mental health outreach re educational material on PTSD
and effort to educate Veterans about PTSD.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is actively engaged in
educational outreach to Veterans and their families on Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSD). One of the best sources of educational materials is the VA
National Center for PTSD Web site: www.ncptsd.va.gov. This site has resources
for Veterans of all service eras including Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation
lraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) Veterans. It also has materials relevant to Veterans of
various racial and ethnic groups as well as for women Veterans. VA's
MyHealtheVet Web site, www.MyHEALTHeVet, also has information on PTSD

Page 9 of 56
",0,0,0,0
495,"for Veterans and families. The most recent source of informational outreach on
PTSD and other mental health issues is a web based resource designed for
support of college students and their counselors which is found at
www.mentalhealth.va.gov. Information about VA services is also provided about
PTSD and other mental health issues at a variety of community interactions such
as stand downs or other opportunities for face-to-face information sharing. Stand
downs are typically 1 to 3-day events providing services to homeless Veterans
such as food, shelter, clothing, health screenings, VA and Social Security
benefits counseling, and referrals to a variety of other necessary services, such
as housing, employment and substance abuse treatment. Stand downs are
collaborative events, coordinated between local VA facilities, other government
agencies, and community agencies who serve the homeless.

Section 213, Outreach Program to Veterans in Rural Areas.

The Office of Rural Health (ORH) fully appreciates the need for strategic
outreach to the Nation’s rural Veteran community. In response to this recognized
need, ORH has implemented a number of initiatives designed to communicate to
the entire rural Veteran community, which includes minority Veterans. The ORH
has undertaken significant steps to not only increase rural Veteran’s access to
health care, but also to increase outreach efforts that will inform Veterans, their
families, and other stakeholders within the rural communities of the multitude of
available benefits that VA provides.

Specific ongoing initiatives include:

e ORH web site: ORH recently launched its web site,
www.ruralhealth.va.gov, which will serve as a central repository for
rural health information;
e Veterans Rural Heath Advisory Committee (VRHAC): The VRHAC
advises the Secretary of VA on health care issues affecting enrolled
Veterans residing in rural and highly rural areas and examines ways to
improve and enhance VA services for enrolled Veterans residing in
those areas. The Committee evaluates current ORH program
activities, identifies barriers to providing services and provides
recommendations. The VRHAC invites the public to participate during
at least two meetings each year;
e Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs): VRHRCs
serve as Satellite offices to the ORH and assist the office with
monitoring and meeting the needs of rural Veterans by implementing
practices and products designed to address these critical issues facing
the Veterans;

Page 10 of 56
",0,0,0,0
496,"e Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Rural Consultants
Network: Twenty-one VA staff located across the country work to
establish an ORH Community of Practice and develop a stronger link
between VA Central Office, ORH and the VISNs; and

e ORH Educational Symposia Series: This series consists of
information events that are hosted in public venues and addresses
topics relevant to rural and highly rural Veteran health care. Many of
these symposia are focused toward VA and non-VA service providers;
however, public interaction is encouraged.

ORH will continue to explore opportunities to engage and inform the rural
health community stakeholders and develop and implement communication
strategies that align with the core mission of the office and result in improved
care to its Nation's Veterans.

Section 215, Expansion of Outreach Activities of Vet Centers.

Readjustment Counseling Service (RCS) has hired and is maintaining a
cadre of 100 Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)
Veterans assigned to Vet Centers throughout the country to provide outreach
services to their fellow Veterans returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The OEF/OIF Veteran outreach workers actively outreach Veterans at Active
Duty Military, National Guard and Reserve demobilization sites, as well as other
community events attended by Veterans and their family members. The Vet
Center outreach workers also accompany Vet Center counselors in attendance
at every Post Deployment Health Reassessment event. These fellow Veteran
outreach specialists provide Veteran peer services to effectively build immediate
rapport and mitigate the stigma among combat Veterans related to seeking
professional assistance.

Post-9/11 Gl Bill Veterans Education Assistance Act of 2007: VA developed a
comprehensive outreach campaign on the Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA conducted a
national rollout event for August 3, 2009, announcing the issuance of the first
benefit payments. Additional outreach materials promoting the Post-9/11 GI Bill
will be distributed to state Veterans Affairs offices and VA facilities, including
medical centers, and community-based outpatient clinics, and national
cemeteries. VA is contracting with an advertising agency to assist us in
promoting and educating individuals on the Post-9/11 GI Bill throughout the
coming year.
World War Il Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund: Section 1002 of the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 authorizes one-time
payments to eligible Filipino Veterans through the Filipino Veterans Equity
Compensation Fund (FVEC). On February 20, 2009, VA issued a nationwide
press release informing the public of the benefit and how to apply. In addition,
Page 11 of 56
",0,0,0,0
497,"the Manila Regional Office (RO) conducted extensive outreach to inform
Veterans about the FVEC payments and assist them in filing applications. VA
released procedural instructions addressing FVEC payments to all regional
offices on March 27, 2009; and on April 3, 2009, VA began releasing FVEC
payments to eligible beneficiaries. VA has received over 30,000 claims for this
benefit.

Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUV) will
establish an organizational strategic plan which aligns with the Department’s new
FY 2010-2014 strategic plan. One component of the OSDBU plan will be to
establish a formal strategic communications plan, in coordination with the CMV
and other VA offices.

3. Stress collaborative efforts among State Directors and
Commissioners of Veteran Affairs in preparing VA’s Biennial Report to
Congress for all outreach activities.

Rationale: State Directors and Commissioners of Veteran Affairs know
the rights, benefits, and the needs of the Veterans like their own peers in their
respective states. Most of the State Veterans Affairs Directors and
Commissioners usually have evaluated the current programs and identified the
barriers to healthcare associated with the Veterans in their own state. The VA
functions best when all its state Veterans Affairs offices work together with the
VA.

VA Response: Concur in principle. VA leadership recognizes the need
to enhance the Department’s working relationship with State Directors,
Commissioners of Veterans Affairs and County Veterans Service Officers. VA’s
Office of Intergovernmental Affairs is partnering with states and counties to
improve outreach efforts to Veterans and their families, support and share best
practices, and increase communication between the Department, State and
County officials.

4. All VA outreach activities should follow an integrative approach.

Rationale: The need for an effective integrated, coordinated outreach
approach was highlighted at a July 12, 2007 joint hearing of the Subcommittee
on Health and the Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs of
the Committee of Veterans Affairs regarding issues facing women and minority
Veterans. Most recently, Town Hall meetings conducted by the Committee in
April 2009, in Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD, identified a wide range of
outreach concerns. Veterans expressed concerns about effective coordinated
and integrated outreach efforts for benefits such as health care, disability,
homelessness, vocation training, employment, business development
opportunities, and others.

Page 12 of 56
",0,0,0,0
498,"VA Response: Concur in principle. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Intergovernmental Affairs is working with senior leadership in VHA, VBA, and NCA
to develop an integrated, department-wide outreach plan to ensure that the
Department's outreach efforts are coordinated across Administrations. Additionally,
VA's website is being redesigned to make it more user-friendly for Veterans, their
families, and other stakeholders trying to access information about benefits and
services from the internet.

NCA has taken steps in making all Veterans more aware of the benefits
and services they provide. NCA has a national outreach effort each year
conducted primarily by cemetery directors and employees at the community
level. Each year, NCA participates in thousands of local events such as VSO
meetings, stand-downs, community fairs and celebrations, and other civic events.
On the national level, NCA participates in 12 to 14 national conventions each
year, primarily conferences of VSOs and professional organizations such as the
National Funeral Directors Association. NCA has also participated in the Women
in the Military Service for America Reunion and the National Summit on Women
Veterans’ Issues. NCA recently created a new outreach flyer directed towards
women and minority Veterans on their external website.

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) views outreach as an important
component of its mission. Every VA medical center (VAMC) has a Minority
Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) assigned to provide outreach to local
minority communities. VHA has also seen fit to convert four MVPC positions to
full time. Outreach is also a function of other staff offices in VAMCs medical
centers (e.g., business offices, public affairs, voluntary services). At the VA
Central Office (VACO) level, collaborative efforts are conducted with other
Federal partners (including Department of Defense, Department of Labor,
Department of Health and Human Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs), Veteran
Service Organizations (VSOs), and with staff from Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). At the
Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and local facility levels, VHA
conducts outreach activities with state, county, city; faith based, and service
organizations to meet the needs of local Veteran populations. The following
examples provide an overview to VHA’s commitment to conduct outreach to
minority Veterans in an integrative manner coordinating with other parts of VA.

Alaska VA Healthcare System

e The Alaska VA Healthcare System (VAHCS) updated its MVPC
Minority Veterans Program Coordinators trifold informational
pamphlet. The trifold lists the VHA, VBA, and NCA Minority
Veterans Program Coordinators.

e The Alaska VAHCS is coordinating an outreach table at the annual
Alaska Federation of Natives conference. This will be the 6th year

Page 13 of 56
",0,0,0,0
499,"e An interdisciplinary team consisting of a VHA psychologist, public
affairs officer, OEF/OIF transition patient advocate, Eligibility/Fee
staff, Vet Center Native American Counselor, and VBA staff, along
with representatives from Tricare, conducted outreach visits to
seven Alaska Native Tribal Health organizations from February
through April 2009. The clinical presentation included information
about Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain
Injury (TBI), and Suicide Prevention and Awareness. Eligibility/Fee
staff, VBA, and Tricare made presentations to Business Office staff
at the health care facilities. In addition, the team staffed information
tables in the community. During that time, 53 events were held with
22/ participants.

e In April 2009, the OEF/OIF case manager presented to the Bristol
Bay Regional Corporation Community Health Aid Program training
conference.

e The OEF/OIF Program Manager and Transition Patient Advocate
have joined the National Guard on several Yellow Ribbon outreach
trips to rural communities in efforts to present information on VA
benefits. Veteran Service Officers have also participated in these
outreach events.

e WVHA continues its annual Tribal Veteran Representative (TVR)
Program. The Alaska VAHCS conducted its first training outside of
Anchorage. This year, it was conducted as a first step towards
regional training. The training in March 2009 was held in Southeast
Anchorage. Both VHA and VBA coordinate and conduct the
training. In addition, quarterly updates are mailed to the TVRs to
keep them informed and connected to changes throughout VA.

e The Alaska VAHCS continues to offer community events that
include outreach to minority Veterans and other Veterans. A
community forum was also offered in Fairbanks, Alaska, this year.

e The Alaska VAHCS is piloting a position called Rural Veteran
Liaison. This is a 3-year temporary position. The position serves
as a VA point of contact in the local community for Veterans
residing in a particular area. The position has been hired and is
based in Bethel, Alaska to cover the Yukon Kuskokwim Health
Corporation area. Both VHA and VBA provide training and regular

Page 14 of 56
",0,0,0,0
500,"points of contact for this position. Setting up video teleconferencing
between Veterans in the area for VHA- and/or VBA- type of
interviews will also be offered as part of this outreach program.

e The Alaska VA Social &and Behavioral Health Service has set up a
Peer-to-Peer consultation process with the Mental Health staff at
the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation. VA screening tools for
PTSD, substance abuse, and TBI have also been shared with the
Staff.

Traditional Healing

e VHA facilities that serve substantial numbers of Native Americans
incorporate the traditional mind-body-spirit approach to healing.

For example, Native American Veterans in treatment for substance
abuse at the VA Salt Lake City Health Care System may have
opportunities to participate in meditation, fire ceremonies,
drumming sessions and sweat-lodge purification ceremonies.

Veterans Readjustment Counseling Service

e Veterans Readjustment Counseling Centers (Vet Centers) have
traditionally made a priority of outreach to high-risk Veteran
populations, including ethnic minorities. Every Vet Center
maintains an outreach plan that is tailored to the diversity of the
local Veteran population. The Vet Center program reflects diversity
in the composition of the Veterans served and in the composition of
the local staff.

Research and Development. VA’s office of Research and
Development includes a wide variety of activities in support of effective
outreach and improved clinical care for minority Veterans, including:

e Research on racial and ethnic disparities has been a priority area
for the Office of Research and Development (ORD) since the
1990s. VA has an extensive and broad-ranging portfolio of
research on disparities, focused on understanding possible reasons
for disparities and, more critically, on developing interventions to
reduce disparities. VA supports resource and infrastructure
development for research in this area and requires investigators to
include women and minority research participants in their studies,
aS appropriate.

e Of particular note is VA’s Center of Excellence for Health Equity
Research and Promotion, based in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
The Center, funded by ORD’s Health Services Research and

Page 15 of 56
",0,0,0,0
501,"Development Service (HSR&D), focuses on disparities related to
race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and comorbid illness in
patients with conditions prevalent among veterans, such as
cardiovascular disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and
alcohol and substance abuse. HSR&D also funds the Center for
Disease Prevention and Health Interventions for Diverse
Populations in Charleston, South Carolina. Investigators with the
program study racial and ethnic variations in treatment and
outcomes for chronic diseases and develop interventions to
eliminate disparities.

e ORD’s implementation research, —such as that conducted through
the Quality Enhancement Research Initiative, in partnership with
VA's Office of Quality and Performance, —translates the findings of
disparities research into improved clinical care for veterans.

e ORD’s Community Outreach program, as part of its outreach to all
VSOs, educates minority VSOs about VA research by attending and
participating in national, regional and Washington, DC-based
meetings. The program has working partnerships with some about 20
minority VSOs.

VBA works closely with VHA and NCA to provide information on VA
benefits and services to service members, Veterans, dependents, and survivors.
Upon entry into the military, service members receive information in the form of
VA Pamphlet 21-00-1, A Summary of VA Benefits. VBA provides media products
and presentations that outline VA benefits and services, including the “Check it
Out” video and Transition Assistance Briefings. VBA Central Office and field
facility staff collaborate closely with their VHA counterparts on outreach
initiatives, including the Disability Evaluation System pilot, pre-discharge
programs, “Welcome Home’ events, the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program,
and Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iragi Freedom (OEF/OIF) case
management support programs.

5. The Director of the Washington, D.C. VA Medical Center and the
Director of the Washington, D.C. VA Regional Office must hold scheduled
Town Hall meetings in order to enable minority Veterans in the
Washington, D.C. area to provide feedback on their issues.

Rationale: In accordance with VA’s Minority Veterans Program
Coordinator (MVPC) Handbook 0801, Facility Directors are required to ensure
outreach to minority Veterans by supporting MVPCs conducting Town
Hall/stakeholders/Veterans Service Organizations/Veterans meetings (at a
minimum two per year) to discuss issues and concerns.

Page 16 of 56
",0,0,0,0
502,"VA Response: Concur in principle. The Washington DC VAMC is
scheduling quarterly town hall meetings in the DC metro area in order to obtain
feedback on their issues and concerns. During the April 7, 2009, town hall
meeting, the VAMC took immediate action to address each Veteran’s concerns.
All Veterans who submitted comments were individually contacted for follow-up,
and each recorded concern has been resolved.

In partnership with the Washington DC Medical Center, VA’s Regional
Office in Washington, DC, has participated in previous minority Veterans town
hall meetings. VA’s Regional Office will continue to provide informational
resources for town hall meetings and is available to participate as the need
arises.

Leaders at the Washington, D.C. Regional Office (WRO) and the VA
Washington DC Medical Center communicate regularly to strengthen outreach to
minority Veterans and expand opportunities for advocacy. Partnership with VHA
is a key component of the WRO's Minority Veterans Program Operating Plan for
FY 2010. The WRO MVPC collaborates with the VAMC MVPC on outreach
efforts, including joint Town Hall meetings.

NCA is aware of VA’s MVPC Handbook 0801 requiring Facility Directors
to conduct town hall meetings at a minimum of two per year. NCA’s MVPCs will
work with VAMC, Regional Offices, VSOs, minority service organizations and
stakeholders to hold town hall meetings every six months to provide minority
Veterans an opportunity to express their issues or concerns and develop
collaborative strategies to address unmet needs.

6. VHA, VBA, NCA and Office of Policy & Planning (OPP) must utilize
common racial and ethnic categorical data in gathering specific
information from available sources/modialities in order to conduct
demographic analysis. This should include the following:

a. Track utilization of benefits of Unique Users by racial and ethnic
groups in the same manner that VA tracks utilization by gender and period
of service.

VA Response: Concur in principle. Currently, NCA does not track
racial and ethnic data of minority Veterans that claim benefits. NCA will
strategize and develop a method to capture this type of data to conduct
demographics analysis.

In 2003, the capture of race/ethnicity information on Veterans enrolling
and using VA health care services was modified in accordance with Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) Directive 15. As a result, VA implemented
changes to reflect the new OMB race categories, moved from observe-reported
to self-reported data collection and allowed selection of multiple race codes (all

Page 17 of 56
",0,0,0,0
503,"consistent with OMB direction). VHA collects information on race and ethnicity
as self-reported by the Veteran through the enrollment process (10-10EZ form)
and in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA)
by VAMC staff. These data are voluntary fields of information provided by the
Veteran and reflect the standard categories as defined by OMB.

With enhancements to information technology systems and further
collaboration with the Department of Defense, VBA plans to capture racial or
ethnic status through either self-identification or authoritative electronic means,
including data transfers.

While OPP does not collect data, OPP concurs with the recommendation
regarding the importance of gathering and analyzing race and ethnicity data.
Though limitations exist, OPP's National Center for Veterans Analysis and
Statistics (NCVAS) mines Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) databases to
affect Departmental needs and requirements. To that end, NCVAS can take the
lead in using DMDC data sources to provide reports on the reliance of minority
Veterans on Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA's) portfolio of benefits and
services.

b. Track Priority 8 enrollment of minority Veterans by encouraging
these Veterans to self-identify in accordance with race classification as
defined by OMB.

c. Track New Post 9/11 GI Bill enrollment of minority Veterans by
encouraging these Veterans to self-identify in accordance with race
classification as defined by OMB.

Rationale: The Committee noted that during the annual briefings, the
reports did not present consistent racial and ethnic categorical data. While
informative for individual VA Departments or Staff Offices, it would be logical that
comparative analysis across VA Departments would produce compromised
results without racial and ethic categorical standards. In addition, the VA has an
opportunity to gather this information by encouraging Veterans to self-identify
during enrollment in new programs such as Priority 8 for medical services, the
new Post 9/11 G.I. Bill, and any other program requiring application for services.
The Committee is constantly struck by the realization that Veterans and their
family members are not aware of VA programs available that can improve their
quality of life, and repay the debt owed by a grateful nation. The Committee also
finds that eligible Veterans and family members are hampered in attaining these
benefits and services due to a lack of understanding of eligibility and application
processes at their level.

VA Response: Concur in principle. Race and ethnicity data is
requested as part of the 10-10EZ enrollment form to facilitate data collection.
The Health Eligibility Center and Chief Business Office have encouraged clinic

Page 18 of 56
",0,0,0,0
504,"and intake staff to collect and enter data on race/ethnicity for all Veterans
enrolling with VA for health care.

OPP concurs with the two recommendations to track minority Veteran
enrollment in the said programs via the utilization of the Office of Management
and Budget’s race/ethnicity categories. NCVAS will assist with the facilitation of
these efforts.

7. VA must continuously promote contract opportunities for
Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and service disabled minority
Veterans, and train a diverse workforce of acquisition professionals.

Rationale: In order to maintain VA’s exemplary status as the only federal
agency that exceeds the statutory 3% goal for Service Disabled Veterans Owned
Small Businesses (SDVOSB), and to develop a knowledgeable and diverse
workforce of acquisition professionals.

VA Response: Concur in principle. The Office of Administration (OA),
Procurement Section, is committed to providing opportunities to the Veteran-
Owned Small Businesses/Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
(VOSB/SDVOSB). It strives to increase the acquisition community's awareness
of the value, dedication, and cost effective solutions that the veteran business
community brings to the federal government.

OA manages to meet the goals established in accordance with P.L.
109.461 and FAR 19.14. It will continue to utilize the VOSB/SDVOSB in support
of its nation’s veterans for the acquisition of goods and services in the future. It
is critical that OA identify vendors, counsel its customers, and support Veteran-
Owned Small Businesses to enable them to help meet its objectives. The current
goal is 7% usage for SDVOB and current usage as of June 2009 is 23.91%.
While it can be a challenge to do so, OA has met all of its socio-economic goals
since FY 2005 with special emphasis on the SDVOB goal. At the end of FY
2008, VACO's SDVOB usage was nearly double the goal at 13.91%.

Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUV) will work
with the Department’s Acquisition Executive or designee in updating Small
Business Program training for the acquisition workforce, to include purchase card
holders, program managers, Contracting Officer’s Technical Representatives and
VA executives. Additionally, OSDBU will work with the CMV and other VA offices
to more widely promote awareness of, and utilization of, all Veteran-owned small
businesses, including those businesses owned by disadvantaged Veterans and
women.

8. Develop and implement a concerted recruitment strategy to
improve the currently under-represented groups.

Page 19 of 56
",0,0,0,0
505,"Note: The Committee was concerned about the disparity in the data with
Hispanics and Native Americans. At the end of FY 2008, VA had a work force of
2//,568. Among this number, all race, national origin and gender groups are
represented in VA above their respective levels in the Civilian Labor Force (CLF)
except for white women and Hispanic men and women. White women represent
35.64% of VA’s work force compared to 47.87 in the CLF. Hispanic men
represent 3.20% and Hispanic women represent 3.52% or a combined 6.72% of
VA’s work force compared to 13.2% CLF.

Rationale: To develop a more diverse workforce representative of all
Veterans and their families that VA serves.

VA Response: Concur in principle. In February 2009, the VA Office of
Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) issued a Strategic Plan for FY 2009-2013. The
concerted recruitment strategy is addressed in Goal 2, “Cultivate an inclusive
workplace that enables full participation through strategic outreach and
retention”; in Objective 2A “Promote strategic recruitment...” and Objective 2C
“Create a diverse pipeline for recruitment...”

There is not room here to list all the strategies identified in this plan
but the major ones are:

e ODI has automated the workforce data analysis and recruitment plans
for each facility in response to Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission Management Directive 715, and now provides workforce
data analysis to support a detailed targeted recruitment plan in each
facility.

e ODI has created the Community Prosperity Partnership (CPP)
program, in which numerous federal agencies, affinity groups,
churches, and local organizations cooperate to conduct job and service
fairs for Veterans. We have conducted nine of these fairs and another
is planned for November as part of the long term plan to do one in
each state.

VBA is continuing its efforts to ensure that we have a diverse workforce
that reflects the population of Veterans served. In FY 2008, VBA’s workforce
data reflects that the following groups were under-represented: White females,
Hispanic Females, and Asian Females. VBA is making a concerted effort to
recruit these under-represented groups by increasing the pool of qualified
applicants through the use of various recruitment programs, including the Federal
Career Internship Program, Summer Intern Program, Student Temporary
Employment Program, Student Career Employment Program, and the promotion
certification process. In FY 2008, VBA’s new hires increased the membership of
each under-represented group in our workforce.

9. Publish an annual status report on the Department’s progress in
accordance with VA’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2009-2013 as
explicitly stated by SECVA’s memorandum dated May 22, 2009.

Rationale: Progress reports allow VA and this Committee to determine
strict compliance and/or trends where implementation of this strategic plan needs
further assistance from upper VA leadership.

VA Response: Concur in principle. The Office of Diversity and
Inclusion (ODI) has initiated the task of updating VA's race, national origin,
disability, and Veteran status categories in accordance with the new classification
standards and expects this process to be completed by the end of this fiscal
year.

10. Expand the Community Prosperity Partnership program (CPP).

Rationale: In order to focus on diversity and recruitment processes, and
to meet the needs of all minority Veterans and their families.

VA Response: Concur in principle. The Community Prosperity
Partnership (CPP) program was originally created to leverage organizational and
community resources to promote employment, educational, and economic
outreach to the Veteran population. It was organizationally placed in ODI
because of the employment outreach focus. In recent practice, the program has
operated primarily as an outreach vehicle to promote and deliver health and
benefits services to the Veteran population primarily through Hispanic affinity
organizations. While this is a valid and most beneficial service, it exceeds the
programmatic scope and expertise of ODI. ODI is currently working on
refocusing CPP as an employment outreach program to diverse constituencies,
consistent with its mission. If however, the desire is to expand the focus, it is
recommended that the program be organizationally placed in an office that is

Page 22 of 56
",0,0,0,0
508,"equipped with the appropriate resources, expertise, and programmatic scope to
effectively deliver these Veterans services.

11. Improve career development programs by targeting newly
promoted GS-11 and above grade employees to prepare them for senior
management positions.

Rationale: To enhance underrepresented groups in senior management
positions and the Senior Executive Service across VA. VA’s MD 715 Report (i.e.
2006-2009) indicates under representation of Hispanic and white women
employees.

VA Response: Concur in principle. VA has developed and is
continuing to enhance a comprehensive suite of leadership and management
development programs. These programs are specifically targeted to the needs
of individuals at each stage of their career. They enable employees of all
backgrounds to enhance their leadership skills at their current level or prepare for
higher levels. All VA employees have access to at least one program at each
level of their career. Many of the programs are centrally funded which helps
enhance the diversity of the participants by ensuring that all employees are able
to compete for the programs, not just those who are in units which have funds.

Non-supervisory employees are able to select from a wide-variety of
courses that will give them the skills and confidence to lead others. There are
programs targeted at specific occupations as well as programs that focus on
universal leadership skills. Examples of programs at this level include:

e The Leadership Advancement and Development Program.

e Central Office Development Program.

e Health System Management Training Program.

e Cemetery Director Intern Program...and many others.

Once an employee becomes a supervisor, there are a wide variety of
support mechanisms to help that employee succeed in that new role. New
supervisors are required to take basic training to ensure that they have the basic
knowledge to succeed in their positions. As they become more experienced,
there are several resources available to help them strengthen their leadership
skills. A few examples include:

e Nursing Management Institute.

e Foreman Certification Training.

e VACO Mentoring Program...and many others.

lf the employee becomes a middle manager, a whole new set of skills are
required. VA offers a suite of resources designed to meet the needs of new and

Page 23 of 56
",0,0,0,0
509,"experienced middle managers in their current roles and prepare them for more
advanced roles. A few examples include:

e Leadership VA.

e Assistant Director Development Program.

e SESCDP.

e Leadership Coaching...and many more.

Once an employee reaches the executive level, VA continues to support
his or her success through a variety of means. Some examples include:

e Senior Management Conference.

e Senior Leadership Academy.

e Senior Executive Orientation.

VA will continue to make major investments in these programs to ensure
that all employees are given the opportunity to gain the skills that they need for
their current positions and to advance in their careers.

NCA has consistently provided internship programs and career
development training opportunities designed to prepare employees with the
knowledge and skills necessary to perform successfully in senior level positions.
NCA’s Cemetery Director Intern Program prepares the selected employees for
leadership positions as a cemetery director or an assistant director through an
intense 12-month program. This program provides leadership, managerial and
customer service skills to operate cemeteries throughout the Nation.

Additionally, the NCA Leadership Institute provides leadership
development to employees who are competitively selected to the program.
Eligible program candidates include all GS 7-12 employees; Wage Grade 6
employees and above; and all Federal Wage System supervisors/team
leaders with high potential and motivation to succeed in a leadership position
within the organization. The NCA Leadership Institute is based on the High
Performance Development Model and was developed in collaboration with
representatives from across the organization. The rationale for the program is
that different leadership skills will be needed to support organizational initiatives
and the culture of VA now and in the future.

The VHA continues to identify and promote progressive training based on
executive development to satisfy potential loss that affect trends and forces that
may impact decisions within the organization. VHA has consistently provided
career development training opportunities designed to prepare all VA employees
with knowledge and skills necessary to perform in higher grades. These
programs include Executive Career Field, Health Care Leadership Institutes and
Leadership VA. All of these programs are based on the High Performance
Development Model Core Competencies.

Page 24 of 56
",0,0,0,0
510,"The Performance Plans for Network Directors and Chiefs are designed to
evaluate VHA executives, and identify actions that Senior Management can take
to bring about positive change and improve the overall organizational
performance. Additionally, the VA National Database for Interns (VANDI) was
implemented to track interns in various VA recognized programs. Interns can
submit their resumes and contact information using VANDI which gives
management visibility of potential employees.

VBA’s Office of Employee Development and Training manages leadership
development programs targeted for employees at the GS-11 level and above:
Leadership Enhancement and Development Program, Division Leadership and
Management Training Program, Leadership Development Program, Assistant
Director Development Program, Introduction to Leadership Course, Leadership
Coaching, and the VBA track of the VA Senior Executive Service Candidate
Development Program.

In addition to these VBA-specific programs, VBA also participates in both
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and VA-sponsored leadership
development programs, designed for employees with demonstrated leadership
potential. These programs include the Presidential Management Fellows
program, seminars offered by OPM’s Management Development Centers, the
Federal Executive Institute, and Leadership VA. VBA’s involvement in these
programs promotes the training and development of a cadre of qualified potential
leaders who represent the broad diversity of VBA’s workforce.

12. Develop and implement a strategy to conduct formal
consultation with tribal governments (whom the U.S. Government
recognizes as sovereign nations), tribal leaders, and Native American
communities. Several presidential addresses state that before a
government agency develops, edits, or implements any programs or
services, they must consult with tribal governments.

Rationale: It is imperative that a new strategy be developed to consult
with all federal and state recognized tribal governments on actions the VA may
take to establish or implement programs and services. The uniqueness of this
concept is to enable a direct relationship between VA and the tribal governments
of Native Americans as specified by Executive Order 13175.

VA Response: Concur in principle.

Note: Responses to recommendations 12 & 13 combined below.

13. Establish an Office of Indian Affairs charged with
communications, consultation and monitoring of the implementation of
programs or services which directly affect Native Americans.

Page 25 of 56
",0,0,0,0
511,"Rationale: This model is similar to the Department of Health & Human
Services’ Office of Tribal Affairs that was established with the responsibility of
communicating, consulting, and monitoring the implementation of any programs,
services or policies that affect Native Americans. This is totally distinctive and
separate from outreach programs.

VA Response: Concur in principle. Plans are being formulated to
develop a staffing capability that will allow for frequent communications,
consultation and outreach to Native American Veterans via tribal leadership.

The Center for Minority Veterans (CMV), in an advisory role, will conduct
collaborative efforts with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and
Intergovernmental Affairs (OPIA) in developing and implementing a strategy to
conduct formal consultation with all tribal governments prior to implementing any
programs or services affecting Native American Veterans. In addition, CMV will
assist OPIA in developing plans and staffing capability that will allow for frequent
communications, consultation and outreach to Native American Veterans via
tribal leadership.

14. VA should continue to ensure that VA’s internal advisory
committees include minority members who are reflective of the Veteran
population and their families being served to date.

Rationale: Support in promoting SECVA’s transformation objectives to
include having Committee members who are knowledgeable and sensitive to
issues related to Veterans afflicted with injuries such as Agent Orange, traumatic
brain injuries, loss of limbs and vision, post traumatic stress disorder, and
invisible injuries that require rapid, innovated and sustained medical and
rehabilitative care that must be made familiar to the diverse groups supporting
and assisting the VA.

VA Response: Concur in principle. Maintaining diversity continues to
be a primary consideration as VA advisory committee members are selected.
Each year, VA advisory committee membership is reviewed to ensure that
various segments of the Veteran population are appropriately represented on the
respective committees. As that review is conducted, particular attention Is
directed toward ethnic, gender, and geographic diversity.

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
April 6-7, 2009
Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO)
Sonny Montgomery Conference Room (230)
Background

The Committee was billeted in Baltimore, Maryland from April 6-10, 2009.
Transportation was provided for the Committee members to briefings and site
visits.

On April 6-7, 2009, the Committee met at VACO for briefings from VACO
leadership, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), and National Cemetery Administration (NCA). The
Committee also received greetings and remarks from The Honorable Eric K.
Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

Previous presentations have been mostly general information with little
information on specific needs or concerns directed to minority Veterans and their
families. In preparation for this year’s briefings, the Committee asked CMV to
convey our need for specific information related to our Committee’s three focal
areas of Outreach, Diversity and Inclusion and Collection of Demographic Data.
The Committee appreciated these presentations which provided informative and
frank discussions concerning these three areas.

The three Administrations and staff offices have provided responses to the
Committee’s recommendations over the years that reflected on various initiatives
in place that supported ongoing actions being taken on issues highlighted in our
recommendations. However, it is evident that there is still some resistance or
lack of support to address the three main issues that have continued to hamper
VA from accomplishing major milestones in its efforts to address Outreach,
Diversity and Inclusion, and Collection of Demographic Data as addressed
below:

Outreach — The presentations were general in subject; however, VA
leadership could do a better job of highlighting successful programs at local
levels that promote outreach in its communities to other local/regional facilities.
While the Committee feels CMV is receiving increased support from upper
leadership, they continue to face some resistance at local levels in support of
outreach activities. Many reports of Town Hall meetings, stand downs, and
health fairs are the main source of outreach activities. Outreach is more than the
occasional large activity that usually includes all local Administrations. Part of
outreach should be a strategy to focus locally and nationally on those Veterans
who may not have modern technical communications and particular focus needs

Page 27 of 56
",0,0,0,0
513,"to be placed in the minority communities. Daily outreach activities within
communities will help VA to overcome the minority population perception that VA
is biased or uncaring. The Committee knows that VA’s mission is to care for
Veterans and their families and that there are VA employees who are proud of
their public service to these Veterans and their families.

Daily outreach activities cannot be successfully accomplished when this
responsibility is a collateral duty. Designating the Minority Veterans Program
Coordinator (MVPC) role as a collateral duty acknowledges the requirement but,
in reality, does not allow the MVPCs to dedicate adequate time and effort
necessary to achieve the level of progress and success required.

Discussion with VBA’s leadership confirmed that daily production duties
(i.e. claims processing) take precedence over any outreach activities when an
employee, who may be on production, has been assigned MVPC collateral
duties. They also confirmed that when they have an opening for additional staff,
they typically select staff to promote production.

Diversity and Inclusion — While this Committee feels there is much work
to do to reach documented milestones in this area, we would like to commend
the Office of Diversity and Inclusion for the development of VA’s first Diversity
and Inclusion Strategic Plan, and we support its alignment with VA’s strategic
objective to “recruit, develop, and retain a competent, committed, and diverse
workforce that provides high-quality service to Veterans and their families.”

Of concern, the Committee asked the leadership during their briefings if
they had read this document. No one reported they had read it and some had no
knowledge of this document. The Committee believes that the Secretary’s
signature would carry the necessary leverage to ensure VA’s commitment to this
important strategic plan and notify VA's leadership to implement its strategies.

The Committee notes that in general, minorities are under represented in
the upper levels of VA regional staff offices. While VA notes there are many
reasons for this issue this Committee feels there is no doubt that attaining a
greater representation of minorities in higher level positions in regional staff
offices would have a positive impact on the overall racial and ethnic sensitivity.

In addition, the public perception of VA would greatly be enhanced as it would be
observed to be more reflective of the communities where Veterans and their
families are served. This may result in easing the concerns of minority Veterans
who may feel VA services are biased based on their racial or ethnic origin.

Demographic Data — It is important to note that minority Veterans still feel
that they are not being treated equally from the establishment of a claim to
services provided by VA’s Administrations. As stated in last year’s report, the
Committee cannot provide these Veterans or their families’ proof that this
perception is not reality because the data is not being collected accurately or

Page 28 of 56
",0,0,0,0
514,"consistently. Currently, VHA, VBA, and NCA are not collecting this information
uniformly thereby hindering any compilation and analysis to determine if
disparities exist to provide services to minority Veterans. The demographic data
must be collected uniformly and analyzed to give accurate accounts of services
and programs provided to minority Veterans.

Most notable and of great concern by this Committee was VBA
representative's response that they would not allow the collection of demographic
data because they did not want their rating specialists potentially biased by this
information. They indicate that knowledge of the claimant’s ethnic or racial
information could negatively impact the Veterans ratings outcome. The
Committee found this to be misleading without substantiation. Specific
discussion brought to light that any medical records used to determine a rating
would most certainly have this information (i.e. medical records usually begin
with identification of the patient as white female, or black male, etc.) Therefore,
this Committee feels this argument to resist the VA General Counsel’s opinion
that the VA has a requirement to gather such data is not valid. Of greater
concern is that VA employees who are making life changing decisions for any
Veteran or their family may not be making unbiased determinations!

Advisory Committee Management — Information, reports, and
recommendations may be duplicated when the subject matter may best be
effectively addressed by another advisory committee. Example: during our
Town Hall meetings the Committee often hears issues and/or concerns from
homeless Veterans, women Veterans, etc., and we believe that rather than
spend time on issues that may have already been addressed by another advisory
committee we believe that issues and/or concerns could be forwarded to the
designated subject advisory committee. In addition, reports and
recommendations from several advisory committees, namely the Advisory on
Minority Veterans (ACMV), Advisory Committee on Women Veterans (ACWV),
and Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans (ACHV) should be cross
analyzed to determine trends and needs to address the common themes
reflected during our respective scheduled meetings.

As stated in our letter to the Secretary dated April 23, 2009, the
Committee believes the convergence of issues and recommendations could be
potentially beneficial to the VA in evaluating the effectiveness of programs by
analyzing trends and needs of these Veterans. In addition, this would obviate the
stove piping effect and provide a programmatic approach to addressing the
systemic challenges facing the VA.

Background
On April 8-9, 2009, the Committee met at the Marriott Inner Harbor in
Baltimore, MD and began the second portion of the combined briefings and site
visit meeting.
ACMV Meeting
The Committee began the meeting by reviewing the VACO briefings by
VA leadership and the Town Hall meeting held April 7, 2009, at Washington, D.C.
VA Medical Center Auditorium.
Discussion

The following discussions and/or comments resulted from this meeting:

e Once again, VA leadership continues to meet minimum requirements to
assign MVPC responsibilities as collateral duties to full time employees
who may not be able to develop and/or implement a credible outreach
program due to original duties which may have them on production. VA
senior leadership must enforce the policy of meeting quality standards
outlined in VA’s MVPC Handbook in supporting their outreach efforts to
minority Veterans.

e The former Secretary indicated that VBA had to provide a plan as to how
they will collect racial and ethnic data. After discussion with VBA Deputy
Under Secretary it is evident that this data collection is still an issue. The
Committee wants this plan provided for our review before our next
meeting.

e Concerns over the Town Hall meeting resulted in issues being raised as
follows: (1) challenges encountered at the VAMC, (2) lack of senior
leadership present at the Town Hall meeting held at the DC VAMC, (3)
some concerns and issues raised may need to be presented to ACWV
and ACHV. The Committee is concerned with duplication of efforts and
that if minority Veteran issues were raised by other advisory committees
we would certainly like to know. The Committee will submit a
recommendation for the collaboration and dissemination of this
information between advisory committees.

The Liaison for American Indian/Alaska Native/Hawaiian Native Veterans
at the CMV, presented a briefing on behalf of the Veterans Integrated Service
Network (VISN) 15 Director on the American Indian/Alaska Native/Hawaiian
Native (AI/AN/HN) Adhoc Work Group formed June/July 2008.

The 15 member AI/AN/HN Adhoc Work Group was established under
Former Secretary Peake whose concerns were (1) Challenges in Accessing
Services, i.e. understanding benefits, accessing benefits from rural locations, and
obtaining funds for travel; (2) Disparities in Health Care, i.e. diseases
disproportionately affect some, need to accept and incorporate traditions. This
adhoc work group was established for six months and expired December 31,
2008; however, the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 15 Director will
be meeting with Secretary Shinseki to determine if the Al/AN/HN Adhoc Work
Group will continue in 2009.

e The objectives included:
o Enhance Department coordination of initiatives
o Improve outreach and communication
o Identify barriers and recommend how VA can better provide

o Improve efficiency and delivery of benefits
o Close gaps in services
o Recommend future initiatives

o Briefing of survey on Traditional Practices
o The challenge will be to ensure the continuity of VA participation
Discussion

The Committee discussed the need to establish an Office of Indian Affairs
charged with establishing communications, consultation, and monitoring of the
implementation of any programs or services which affect Native Americans.
Note: this is not an outreach program. Outreach to Native American Veterans to
communicate already established programs and services is different than the
strategy to consult with tribal governments on actions the VA may take to
establish or implement programs and services. VA could look to other Cabinet
Level Administrations for examples of how they have established and operate
their Office of Indian Affairs.

517,"Briefing

The Committee met with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Panel.
This meeting allowed for panel members to bring forth issues and/or concerns for
their organization, the Veterans they serve, and the relationship they have with
VA. This panel consisted of representatives from the following VSOs:

e Deputy Secretary, Department of Maryland Veterans Affairs.

e Vice Commander, American GI Forum of Texas.

e National Association for Black Veterans.

e Veterans of Foreign War.

e President, National Association for Black Veterans, Washington, D.C.

e National Association for Black Veterans, Baltimore, MD.

Discussion
These are a compilation of the Panel’s key points addressed to the
Committee:

e The greatest void in the Veterans community is information and VA should
remember that not all Veterans have internet services.

e One third of the Maryland National Guard is currently deployed in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and Balkans.

e Veterans travel long distances (up to 10 hours round trip) from south
Texas to the nearest VAMC located in San Antonio which is a hardship on
Veterans who are the most risk for health issues and limited income.

e Mexican American Veterans are most impacted with TBI/PTSD and
readjustment disorders.

e Veterans in south Texas are in desperate need for better medical care.

e Minority Veterans are at risk for suicide, homelessness, low income,
financial literacy, and lack trust that the VA is giving them the same
service that non-minority Veterans are receiving.

e Concerns were raised on why it takes between 6-9 months for claims to
be processed unless they are OEF/OIF, then the VA works the claims in
90 days.

e The Panel recommended that CMV have a Minority Veterans Summit.

The Committee conducted site visits to the following facilities for overview
and tour:

Discussion

The Committee received detailed tours and information for these facilities.
MCVET was an outstanding program which showcases what services and
programs can be implemented with collaboration of a variety of resources.

The Baltimore VAMC (VAMC) provided a large amount of information
during their presentation. Several key staff members were present and were
able to answer questions from the Committee. In addition, VAMC made an effort
to provide demographic data FY09 through January. They acknowledged there
was an under representation of minorities through the GS 12-15 levels and
identified that work was needed in this area. VAMC Staff seemed very willing to
engage the Committee and were proud of their organization.

The Baltimore VARO (VARO) presentation was mostly general information
about the VARO. The Committee asked for specific processing information and
the questions were addressed. The VARO did have some impressive diversity in
their supervisory positions. Out of 170 employees, there are a total of 15
supervisors, 9 are females and 7 are African Americans; in addition, 67.31% are
Minorities, 32.69% are White, 37% are Veterans, and 22% are Disabled
Veterans. Most notably, the MVPC was not present for this meeting. The
director confirmed that the MVPC responsibilities were assigned as collateral
duties. The Committee did recommend that the MVPC not be an individual on
production.

Outreach

Outreach continues to be insufficiently resourced in specifically targeting
minority Veterans. Regional VA leadership continues to look at the short term
when they make decisions to assign MVPC responsibilities as a collateral duty.
There are several points of view concerning outreach and its importance to the
VA as a whole and VA at the regional level.

VA — The VA understands the issues and the need for outreach. They
understand that since they are the second largest Cabinet level Administration
they need advisory committees, advisory groups, and boards to apprise them of
the issues for selected areas of concern. The VA has a public affairs office but
understands that every positive public affairs report is counteracted by a negative
incident that is published or broadcasted in the media, or orally repeated at
Veteran gatherings or meetings, or posted on internet blogs, personal or
organizational web pages. VA also receives feedback from their various
committees, Veteran Service Organizations, and individual Veterans that there is
a great need for communication and contact within communities.

Page 33 of 56
",0,0,0,0
519,"VA Regionally — This VARO knows that it is required to assign several
responsibilities for outreach to emphasis groups such as Minority Veterans,
Women Veterans, Homeless Veterans, etc. However, they are not receiving any
additional staffing for these responsibilities. In addition, they are tasked with
production and/or operations responsibilities. In this day of instant news, it is
important to keep up with production and operations and to do it at optimal
efficiency and timeliness. More importantly, their individual evaluation is based
on many things, production and operations, but not the success or achievements
of their MVPC or their MVPC program. This also means that they are not held
responsible if their outreach program is non-existent. Minimal outreach activities
include stand downs, visits to Veterans organizations, TAP briefings, and post
deployment briefings.

Veteran — The minority Veteran and their family feel they do not know
about or understand VA programs or services unless they are part of a Veteran
organization. They feel that the VA does not provide them the same level of care
or service as their non-minority counterparts. In addition, many live in
communities where long distance travel is required to get to the VA or their
income hinders them from making the long trips to seek help from the VA. Many
of these Veterans do not have access to the internet or do not belong to any
Veteran organization so information about the VA is limited. Trust is an issue
when all they hear about the VA Is the negative incidents. Trust is an issue when
VA employees don't look like anyone in their communities. Trust is an issue
when they don’t see the VA in their communities so they believe that VA doesn’t
care or understand their communities, beliefs, and traditions.

Diversity and Inclusion

The Committee notes there continues to be a lack of minority staff at its
upper levels of management and leadership; however, the Committee has seen
an effort on VA’s part to address this issue. Achieving a greater representation
of minorities in VA’s leadership would have a positive impact on the overall racial
and ethnic sensitivity of its staff as it serves the minority Veteran population. This
visual and attitude change in providing service to the minority Veteran population
would not only help VA to achieve its mission and purpose, but would certainly
help to establish trust with the Nation’s Veterans as a whole. In addition, having
a VA that is representative of its communities would only strengthen and
motivate its most valuable resource — VA employees.

The Committee is very impressed with the work of the VA’s first Diversity
and Inclusion Strategic Plan for FY 2009-2013 as presented by the Office of
Diversity and Inclusion. The vision to become a leader in creating and sustaining
a high performing workforce by leveraging diversity and empowering all
employees to achieve superior results in service to our Veterans is commended.
Of concern, while conducting briefings at VACO, the leadership was asked about
this document and to the Committee’s disappointment they had either not read it

Page 34 of 56
",0,0,0,0
520,"or didn’t know about it. This Committee feels that if the Secretary provides a
memorandum with his signature emphasizing the importance and required
support of this strategic plan the VA leadership will act to begin implementation.

Demographic Data

This Committee cannot stress enough the critical need for unified and
encompassing gathering of demographic data. Availability of the current data
varies substantially by geographic area and significant disparities exist among
the three VA Administrations. The collection and analysis of this data will help
VA to effectively evaluate the administration of VA benefits and services.

The Committee continues to find that minority Veterans feel they are not
provided the same and equal services or care from the VA. While VA briefings
and reports indicate this perception Is not true, it is hard to counteract this
perception when there Is no data to support or disprove it.

The Committee found that even though Former Secretary Peake tasked
VBA with providing a plan for the collection of this data, VBA advised the
Committee that they had a concern that an employee may be biased in their
decision making if this information was available in the claim. As stated
previously, this information is provided in the medical records which the
employee must look at to make a determination for rating so this is not a valid
concern. This Committee requested that VBA provide a plan for the collection of
this data to this Committee. In our letter to the Secretary dated April 23, 2009,
we asked for this plan to be submitted no later than May 31, 2009. As of this

521,"Part IV — Town Hall Meetings
The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
April 7 & 9, 2009
Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington, D.C.
Marriott Inner Harbor Baltimore, MD
Background

Town Hall Meetings were conducted at the Washington, D.C. VA Medical
Center on April 7, 2009, and in Baltimore at the Marriott Inner Harbor on April 9,
2009.

Town Hall Meetings
The common themes addressed were as follows:
e Mistreatment of Veterans and families at the VA facilities.
e Need better resources for dialysis so Veterans do not have to travel to
different locations for different treatments.
e Long wait to get an appointment.
e Benefits need to be provided for Filipino Veterans of WWII.
e Need to educate/outreach to minority Veterans.
e Concern that VARO in Washington, D.C. had closed.
e Lengthy processing of claims because they are not processed locally.
e Women Veteran's health care issues:
o Accessibility
o Safety
e Homeless Veterans:
o Outreach is not adequately conducted
o Services availability

These are ongoing systemic issues that the VA needs to consistently
strive to resolve. Veterans were passionate, articulate, and welcomed the
opportunity to have their voices heard.

In addition, it is essential for senior leaders of VA Medical Centers,
Regional Offices, and key members of their staff to be present at these sessions
to ensure that prompt attention to the issues of the Veterans requesting
assistance are met. While the Committee is there to listen to issues, when
Veterans ask questions on personal issues and/or need expert knowledge, the
Committee must be able to rely on VA staff to assist.

Leadership
The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
April 10, 2009
Marriott Inner Harbor Baltimore, MD
Stadiums 1-2-3

Background

Exit Interviews with local VA leadership are conducted at the end of each
site visit to review site visits at VA facilities, Town Hall meetings, and
issues/concerns raised by local Veterans, their families, VA staff, and the
Committee. The purpose is to allow the VA staff to address identified local
issues/concerns and for the Committee to make recommendations based upon
local and national issues/concerns that would improve the administration of VA
benefits for Veterans who are minority group members in the areas of
compensation, health care, rehabilitation, outreach, and other services.
Briefing

VA leadership and some key staff were present for the exit interviews.
Comments and discussions were frank and informative from VA leadership. The
Committee stressed the importance of VA leadership to understand the
importance and their personal responsibility to support the CMV mission, the role
and responsibilities of the local MVPCs, and the Committee’s reason for the site
visits.
Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC) Program

VA leadership acknowledged their MVPC Program is not where it needs to
be, but they have committed to strive to improve their program by reassessing
their current program, providing support to their MVPCs, and ensuring the MVPC
quarterly report is complete and on time.
Outreach

The DC VAMC indicated they conduct six Town Hall meetings quarterly
for staff and volunteers. The concern of the Committee is that while the VAMC is
counting this as an outreach activity, it is not reaching Veterans and their families
if it is targeted to staff and hospital volunteers. The DC VAMC agreed to host a
Town Hall meeting to reach out to the local minority Veterans’ community and
local Veteran Service Organizations, in order to promote collaboration in
providing current VA Veteran benefit, service and assistance information.

523,"Diversity and Inclusion

VA leadership have committed to review the VA Office of Diversity and
Inclusion’s Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for FY 2009-2013. They
acknowledge that diversity and inclusion is not a secondary issue, but Is critical
to supporting VA’s mission and purpose.
Demographic Data

VA leadership acknowledged the importance to the Committee to capture
demographic data; however, no plan of action or commitment was noted.
Conclusion

The Committee feels local VA leadership now understands the importance
of their role to provide support and encourage their staff to provide improved
outreach and services to minority Veterans. However, this Committee believes
there needs to be some follow up to ensure they are supporting CMV and
MVPCs.

The 2011 Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
provides the Committee’s assessments, observations, recommendations, and rationales
that address the effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) provision of
services to minority Veterans, their families, and survivors.

ACMV met its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in
accordance with Public Law 103-446 and VA Charter on the Advisory Committee on
Minority Veterans dated March 17, 2010. The ACMV met on April 4-6, 2011, at VA
Central Office (VACO) and received briefings from Veterans Health Administration
(VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration
(NCA), and select staff proponents. The ACMV also conducted a Veterans Town Hall
meeting in Springfield, Virginia, on the evening of April 6. Ex Officio members from the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Defense (DoD),
Department of Labor (DOL), and Department of Commerce (DOC) provided briefings on
their respective missions and services provided to Veterans. The site visit was
conducted on April 7, 2011, at the Washington, DC VA Medical Center (VAMC); an exit
briefing session was also conducted at VACO on the morning of April 8, 20171.

ACMV has historically highlighted a need for VA to:

e Continue and enhance targeted outreach to minority Veterans to encourage
use of VA benefits and services to counter adverse conditions in minority
communities.

e Enhance the utilization and visibility of Minority Veterans Program
Coordinators (MVPC) as the key resource in promoting effective, culturally
relevant, and targeted outreach to minority Veterans.

e Enhance the collection and analysis of demographic data which reflects the
level of utilization of VA benefits and services by minority Veterans.

e Ensure that VA personnel succession planning initiatives facilitate an increase
in the number of minorities in senior leadership positions of the Department.

e Ensure that VA healthcare initiatives address clinical disparities in the minority
Veteran population.

e Ensure that all Veterans living in rural, highly rural, and insular areas are
provided appropriate access to VA benefits and services.

During the course of conducting site visits and especially Veterans Town Hall
meetings, ACMV has noted that Veterans of all races/ethnicities from World War Il,
Korean, Cold War, and Vietnam eras are in great need of VA’s benefits and services.
Many of these individuals are retired and living on fixed incomes during this period of a
troubled national economy. These at-risk Veterans, their families, and survivors in
many cases are not aware of the benefits and services VA has available to enhance
their quality of life. In some cases, some feel that VA has placed their claims and
concerns on the back burners. These individuals need the same emphasis on outreach

3
",0,0,0,0
545,"and assistance that is presently being given to Veterans of recent conflicts (Operation
Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom).

The intent of ACMV’s meetings was to assess, observe, and query on the
effectiveness of VA’s current initiatives for all Veterans, and to identify the impact these
initiatives have on the unique needs of minority Veterans, their families, and survivors.
While improving the system of outreach and delivery of benefits and services to these
minority Veterans, VA will improve outcomes for all Veterans by being people-centric,
results-driven and forward-looking in meeting the unique needs of minority Veterans.
The 2011 report contains 13 recommendations that include 6 recurring
recommendations:

1) Establish hiring and retention strategies and increase recruitment of minorities to
improve minority representation within the Senior Executive Service (SES)
ranks. (Recurring)

2) Review the current diversity and inclusion training and update the training
modules to include areas of cultural competence.

3) Evaluate the effectiveness of outreach methods to minority communities
conducted by individuals other than Minority Veterans Program Coordinators.
(Recurring)

4) Develop and implement an action plan to increase the utilization of Minority
Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) in all departmental targeted outreach
activities to minority Veteran communities. (Recurring)

5) Develop and implement, based upon input from minority Veteran focus groups, a
culturally relevant communications strategy and promote awareness of VA
benefits and services to targeted communities.

6) Veterans Health Administration Office of Rural Health perform a comprehensive
needs assessment to determine the impact of transportation barriers on the
health of minority Veterans residing in rural and highly rural areas. (Recurring)

7) Develop an action plan to increase access to VA programs, services, and
facilities for Veterans living in rural and outlying territories and insular areas.
(Recurring)

8) Develop a plan to implement, where applicable, the Seventeen
Recommendations To Donor Agencies Resulting From the Department of
Interior Insular Area Health Summit September 2008.

9) Develop and implement a strategy to enact guidelines in accordance with the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) National Partnership Action
Plan to end health disparities.

10) Establish an Office of Health Equity (OHE) similar to the Offices of Minority
Health (OMH) within the Department of Health and Human Services. (Recurring)

11) Develop an action plan with a goal of effecting a meaningful reduction in racial
disparity among active patients enrolled in the VA healthcare system.

12) Increase funding to collaborative partnerships, with Community Based
Organizations (CBOs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) that provide
assistance to homeless Veterans.

13) Propose legislation that will change the reporting requirement for an annual
report from the ACMV to a biennial report.

responses from VA proponents include specific data and updates to the
recommendations. In addition, we also request that the proponents provide updates to
their responses during ACMV’s annual meeting normally held on or about November of
each year at VACO. ACMV commends the senior leadership of the three VA
Administrations, staff offices at VACO, Washington, DC VA Medical Center, DC VA
Regional Office, and the Veterans at the Veterans Town Hall meeting in Springfield,
Virginia, for their receptiveness to ACMV’s comments and questions. We also thank VA
officials for their outstanding support and services to minority Veterans, their families,
and survivors. Special thanks to the staff of the Center for Minority Veterans for their
continued outstanding support of ACMV.

In summary, we appreciate the Secretary’s and the Department’s confidence in
ACMV’s efforts and the Department’s responses to the annual report. We hope this
report assists the Department in Its initiatives to provide services that are more people-
centric, results-driven, and forward-looking to meet the needs of all Veterans, their
families, and survivors.

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
April 4-8, 2011
Background

The Committee conducted its meeting at VA Central Office (VACO), participated
In a site visit to the Washington, DC VA Medical Center (VAMC), and facilitated a
Veterans Town Hall Meeting in Springfield, Virginia. These sessions provided an
opportunity for the members to conduct interviews with VA leadership; have direct
contact with Veterans, family members, survivors, and Veteran Service Organizations;
and formulate recommendations for the Department’s consideration to improve the
provision of benefits and services to minority Veterans, their family members, and the
general Veteran population.

In formulating the recommendations below, ACMV proposes that the first step in
establishing a powerful organizational climate for Diversity and Inclusion starts at the
top with recruiting and retaining senior executives from all backgrounds and then
developing a culturally competent team through training and development. Witha
culturally competent organizational culture as a foundation, the Department can develop
culturally relevant outreach programs to reduce access barriers and disparities in health
care and address the Department's priorities, particularly in reducing Veteran
homelessness. Ultimately, top leadership must communicate that a long-term
commitment to diversity and cultural competence is of strategic value in delivering
patient-centered and equitable services and care to all Veterans.

Recommendations
A. Diversity
1. Establish hiring and retention strategies and increase recruitment of
minorities to improve minority representation within the Senior Executive
Service (SES) ranks by 2012, with a goal of attaining a significant increase in
minority representation within the ranks of the SES within the Department by
2015.
Rationale: As it endeavors to foster an environment that is diverse in membership,
results-oriented, and high-performing, VA must have a workforce reflective of the
communities it serves in order to truly provide patient-centered, culturally competent
services to Veterans and their families. Acknowledging the importance of culturally
competent healthcare practices, The Joint Commission published patient-centered
communication standards (including cultural competence) in the 2011 Comprehensive
Accreditation Manual for Hospitals (CAMH): The Official Handbook and will be using
6
",0,0,0,0
548,"these standards for accreditation decisions sometime after January 2012.' To help
organizations meet these standards, The Joint Commission published the monograph
“Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient-and Family-
Centered Care: A Roadmap for Hospitals,” which offers recommendations for building
organizational readiness including targeting recruitment efforts to increase the pool of
diverse and bilingual candidates.
The Department should equally focus on creating an environment that is inclusive and
allows for the attraction and cultivation of talent to support the VA’s mission and
priorities. The Management Directive 715 Report (Table A4-1) for VA for Fiscal
Year (FY) 2010 reflected, the Senior Executive Service (SES) consisted of 322
employees. A closer examination reveals the following: 53.73% WM, 28.57% WF,
4.66% AAM, 4.97% AAF, 3.73% HM, 1.24% HF, .31% NH/PIM, 0% NH/PIF, .93%
NA/ANM, 0% NA/ANF, 1.24% AM, and .31% AF. This data shows the disparity that
exists at the senior levels of the agency, and the need to immediately implement a
strategy to ensure that the Department's leadership is reflective of the community it
serves. Additionally, the data presented in the Management Directive 715 FY 2010
EEO Report /FY 2011 EEO Plan also suggests that promotional opportunities for
minorities stagnate at the GS-7/8 level of the organization.
As stated in the Chief of Staff's letter numbered 006-11-2 on February 11, 2011, there is
a need for increased diversity within the SES, and the overall workforce within VA. In
order to foster a nurturing environment that truly values a diverse workforce, the Office
for Diversity and Inclusion, with the Secretary's support, must work with senior
leadership to gain executive buy-in to level the playing field. This effort can be
accomplished by providing senior leadership with cultural competence and sensitivity
training to understand the vast and diverse Veteran community the Department
employs, serves and interacts with in terms of service delivery.

Diversity and Inclusion (ODI)
VA Response: Non-concur
VA does not endorse race-conscious hiring goals as they violate Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, as amended. We do, however, strongly support outreach and
retention strategies, including those that focus on groups with less than expected
representation or low participation rates the workforce. These strategies are currently
included in VA’s 5-year Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for fiscal year (FY) 2009-
2013. Among these strategies are targeted outreach to these communities for
leadership development programs and Senior Executive Service (SES) recruitment.

549,"2. Review the current diversity and inclusion training and update the training
modules, by the end of FY 2011, to include the topics of cultural competence and
emotional intelligence to ensure that they are relevant to address the Diversity
and Inclusion challenges that are present in the VA.

Rationale: Building a diversity-sensitive and Veteran-centered organization not only
relies on having a diverse blend of talented leaders at the top, but also a strong diversity
and inclusion training program for all levels of employees. In order to develop diversity-
sensitivity’, leaders need to develop self-awareness regarding potential biases, identify
and empathize with diverse perspectives that may differ from their own, and then
translate this new understanding into respectful and effective interpersonal relationships
with others’. In essence, these skills are the foundations of emotionally intelligent and
culturally competent behaviors. In order to strengthen these behaviors, the
administration needs to provide opportunities for the SESs and all VA employees to
participate in cultural immersion experiences within each area of the minority community
it serves. This experiential forum often helps the leader and employees gain an
understanding of the perceptions of the organization within the community, as well as
stimulates new ideas from the top of the organization that lead to the creation of policy
and action to create equitable solutions for all employees, specifically the
underrepresented Federal employees that have experienced inequities in promotional
opportunities. With the implementation of this experiential learning, the Department will
afford an opportunity to provide valuable insight to senior leaders and employees of the
stakeholder communities they serve: staff, Veterans, and their family members seeking
assistance, and the public at large.

VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA agrees to review current diversity and inclusion training and update training
modules; however, this task may not be completed by the end of FY 2011. Given the
scope of the task, we expect to complete this task by the end of the 1* quarter of
FY 2012.
VHA has already commenced reviewing diversity and inclusion training programs.
VHA launched a Diversity and Inclusion SharePoint site in November 2010 and a
Community of Practice (COP) site in January 2011. The SharePoint site is open to all
VA employees. The COP meets quarterly via conference calls that focus on relative
cultural competency issues and topics. Calls to date include: VA Diversity and

Bisexual, and Transgendered Cultural Competency (April 2011).

In addition, VHA conducted the Rural Health Professions Institute for 2011, which
included experiential training on cultural competency. The National Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) Managers Conference, June 2011, included a 3-hour experiential
training session on cultural competency and unconscious bias. Many EEO managers
are conducting cultural competency training at their Veterans Integrated Service
Networks (VISN) and facilities. ODI will provide cultural competency and unconscious
bias training to VISN 11 in FY 2012.

Cultural competency is included throughout our present instruction modules through a
variety of face-to-face and resource materials found on the ODI Web site. Diversity and
inclusion are topics that are aligned with cultural competency and also form the base
knowledge in order to advance to the cultural competency level.

Current educational resources addressing specific and secondary elements of cultural
competency and the cultural competency continuum include the following PowerPoint
presentations:

e Suspending Judgment: A Key to Being Culturally Competent

e Diversity and Inclusion in VA’s Workforce

e Diversity and Inclusion - Workplace Cultural Awareness - Honoring Differences

e Envisioning the Future, Honoring the Past-Generational Perspectives in the

Workforce
e A Cohesive Approach: Performance, Innovation, and the Cultural Competency
Continuum
In addition to the above, ODI partnered with VHA and the Rural Health Professions
Institute for five separate trainings and in FY 2011 presented the Cultural Diversity and
Competency Considerations for Health Care course for VHA medical professionals.
ODI presented training during FY 2011 in venues to include but not limited to:

e NCA Annual Conference (April 2011)

e VHA Pre-Conference for EEO Managers (June 2011)

e VA Acquisitions and Logistics to include the Acquisitions Academy (Ongoing)

e Human Resources Conference (July 2011 and August 2011)

e VHA and Rural Health Professions Institute (February, March, April, May, June ,

and August 2011)

e Three VBA Regional Offices with five more scheduled before the end of FY 2011
ODI continually revises and adapts diversity and inclusion curriculum based upon
specific targeted audiences and client requests for specific training in order to address
their needs and meet their objectives.

ODI will brief and discuss with ACMV members the inclusion of “emotional intelligence”
into our existing presentations during their October 24-28, 2011 meeting at VA Central

and acceptable definitional terms, inclusion expectations, etc. After the discussion and
by September 30, references to “emotional intelligence” and/or other specific relevant
disciplines in ODI presentations will be adapted to address this recommendation.
Ninety-six percent of all NCA supervisory staff are in compliance with VA’s Diversity and
Inclusion Strategic Plan and have taken VA's on-line EEO and Diversity and Conflict
Management Training for Managers. NCA’s Office of Diversity Management and
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Programs have partnered with the Human
Resources offices and Labor Relations staff to develop inclusion and diversity initiatives
for NCA. In May 2011, officials of the four offices met in St. Louis, Missouri, to work on
strategies to implement overarching human capital investment architecture for NCA.
This initiative encompasses equal employment opportunities for internal and external
entities; outreach to Veterans and prospective applicants; recruitment; and cultural
competency strategies. The group continues to meet monthly via teleconference to
discuss progress and next steps. NCA is in the beginning stages of developing a
nation-wide Special Emphasis Program, which will be tasked with identifying and
addressing cultural competency skill gaps within the management and line staff. NCA
continues to provide diversity training to managers through on-site visits and quarterly
supervisory training sessions. At the National NCA Annual Conference, held in April
2011, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the ODI presented a three hour training session to all
NCA supervisors on diversity, cultural competency, conflict management, sexual
harassment prevention, and new initiatives relating to these topics in VA. The newly
appointed Special Emphasis/Minority Veterans Program Specialist has participated in
national special emphasis conferences (i.e. American GI Forum; Federally Employed
Women’s Training Conference), and is scheduled to attend the Annual Blacks in
Government Training Meeting and National Organization of Mexican Rights. Through
these venues, the specialist will develop skills to assist in the continued development of
NCA’s cultural competence and emotional intelligence strategies.
VBA will review current diversity and inclusion training. VBA will collaborate with ODI to
review the specific diversity training modules. The Benefits Assistance Services (BAS)
will promote diversity-training opportunities for outreach personnel and other field staff
by working with ODI and other VA Education and Training programs. In addition, VBA
will review current diversity training courses offered through the talent management
systems.

minority communities.
Rationale: Although minority Veterans currently comprise of only 19% of the total
Veteran population, they represent approximately 50% of the homeless Veteran
population. As the number of minorities that are joining the military service rises with
dramatic demographic shifts in the U.S. population (where racial and ethnic minorities
made up about 90% of total U.S. population growth since the 2000 Census), minority
Veteran numbers are projected to increase as the overall Veteran population declines.
Establishing deeper relationships within minority communities will become increasingly
important to build trust and reinforce the perception that VA supports minority Veterans
and their families. Effective health service delivery to Veterans, in general as a primary
mission of VA, is an issue of outreach and communication of useful information and
culturally relevant interaction with patients to promote healing from injury and disease.

555,"There are cultural differences within each group that make delivery of information and
services difficult at best because the caregiver must be a trusted, culturally sensitive
and understood healer. Not all Spanish-speaking people are alike culturally. There are
close to 600 tribes in the United States with Veterans from all wars, and no two tribes
are alike culturally. A rural African American culture is very different from an urban
African American culture.
Though VHA indicated that it participates in community outreach, it appears that
minority Veterans and their families are exposed to general health messages rather
than outreach messages tailored to their unique cultures and health beliefs. VBA did
not address outreach to minority Veterans during the meeting, and NCA demonstrated
considerable improvements in reaching out to minority Veterans through its marketing
materials and Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs). In order to reach
minority Veterans effectively and efficiently, outreach and education messages should
be tailored for and targeted to reach specific minority communities since general
messages may be less personally relevant and impactful.” In order to prepare for the
Increasing minority Veteran population, it is necessary to develop and implement plans
of action including specifically targeted outreach and education programs that provide
benefits counseling, claims filing assistance, employment assistance, and small
business development for minority Veterans.
Action Office: VHA, VBA, NCA, Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs (OPIA)
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA agrees to evaluate the effectiveness of its outreach methods to minorities, and to
implement changes to enhance outreach and communication to minority Veterans;
however, evaluating existing outreach efforts to minority Veterans may extend beyond
the end of FY 2011. VHA will continue to monitor and enhance outreach methods to
reach Veterans; however, our outreach does not target specific ethnic groups of
Veterans. Rather, our outreach efforts are intended to communicate to all Veterans,
regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or religion. VHA’s Operation Enduring
Freedom/Operation lragi Freedom office provides coordination and guidance for local
VAMCs and their respective VISN for outreach to National Guard and Reserve
Servicemembers who are returning from deployment in combat operations.
NCA has hired a full-time National MVPC. This position is responsible for developing
outreach strategies and training field MVPCs and other participants who will be involved
in outreach activities. Since coming on-board in June 2011, the National MVPC has
attended two national special emphasis conferences, and received an in-depth briefing
on the minority Veterans program in VA conducted by the Center for Minority Veterans
Office. While attending the national meetings, the National MVPC interacted with
various organizations and persons who will serve as a major resource in the
development of NCA’s outreach strategies.

focused on minorities and Veterans (i.e., American GI Forum, HEROs and Heritage
Program/Career Fair; Marine Corps League; Veterans Opportunity Expo, Veterans of
Foreign Wars, Federally Hispanic Women’s Executives Conference, League of United
Latin American Citizens National Women’s Conference, and many others). Staffing
these events were employees who hold various positions within NCA to include
cemetery directors, administrative staff, VACO personnel, as well as designated
MVPCs.
This past Memorial Day, NCA held 118 ceremonies nation-wide reaching more than
100,000 people. These types of celebrations increase community awareness of the
services and benefits provided by the administration. For 2010, NCA achieved a
customer satisfaction index of 94 from the American Customer Satisfaction Index
(ACSI). This is the fourth consecutive time in 10 years NCA has obtained this honor.
ASCI is the only national, cross-industry measure of satisfaction with the quality of
goods and services available in the United States.
VBA will collaborate with OPIA and Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) in the creation
of an action plan for increased outreach and tailored messaging to targeted minority
communities. VBA, in conjunction with OPIA, CMV, VHA, and NCA, will review and
incorporate marketing strategies, materials, and feedback from other program
coordinators (e.g., Women Veterans Coordinators). VBA will review after-action
information to determine the effectiveness of the outreach delivery initiatives that
include briefings, personal interviews, periodic conference booths and exhibits, and
additional publications for minority communities (e.g., pamphlets and fact sheets that
are printed in Spanish). VBA will increase and coordinate outreach activities, working
with VACO elements, VBA regional offices, VAMCs, and VA cemeteries.

4. Develop and implement an action plan to increase the utilization of Minority
Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) in all departmental targeted outreach
activities to minority communities by 1st Quarter FY 2012. That MVPCs spend
18
",0,0,0,0
560,"an average of 25 hours per month on targeted outreach activities to minority

Veteran communities with a goal of increasing the percentage of minority

Veterans contacted to 60%.
Rationale: Review of MVPC reports from FY 2010 reflects that the outreach activities
conducted by MVPCs resulted in minority Veterans being 40% of the overall total of
Veterans contacted. As outlined in the VA Handbook 0801 for Minority Veterans
Program Coordinators (MVPC), the primary purpose of MVPC outreach activities is to
contact minority Veterans; therefore, the ACMV feels that a target of 60% is more
appropriate to their responsibilities. MVPCs are the ambassadors or “eyes and ears” for
the VA in minority Veteran communities. They are essential resources in developing
targeted outreach messages and building trust-based partnerships with minority
Veteran communities and other community stakeholders.
In addition, according to VA Handbook 0801 “Minority Veterans Program Coordinator”
with respect to outreach, facility Directors should: “Ensure outreach to minority groups,
supporting the MVPCs in conducting town hall/stakeholders/Veterans Service
Organizations/Veterans meeting at a minimum twice per year to discuss issues and
concerns.” It is unclear as to whether this is enforced consistently across all VA
facilities. Given that in most facilities the role of MVPC is a collateral duty (less than or
equal to 25%), it is imperative that facility Directors remain vigilant in ensuring MVPCs
are fully integrated into facility operations to advocate on behalf of minority Veterans
and to ensure that targeted outreach is conducted. In fact, the MVPC Handbook
requires the VA facility director to ""support the MVPC and ensure he/she is provided the
necessary resources to effectively perform the functions inherent in this position (e.g.
allow sufficient time to perform the duties, provide computer access/email, and fund
project and or special programs, as required).” This population of Veterans will only
grow over time, and MVPCs are essential in ensuring access to services and benefits
through targeted outreach.
Action Office: VHA, VBA, NCA, and CMV
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA agrees to increase the utilization of MVPC in all targeted outreach efforts to
Veterans, including minority Veterans; however, developing and implementing an action
plan may extend beyond the 1*' quarter of FY 2012. Five VHA full-time MVPCs have
made significant impacts in outreach to the minority Veteran communities. Full-time
MVPCs work closely and collaboratively with community groups, Veterans Service
Organizations, county, state and Federal officials to reach more minority Veterans; thus,
significantly increasing the number of minority Veterans who are aware of VA benefits
and health care services.
During the national MVPC training conference, NCA had seventy-one participants.
During the training, the MVPCs were instructed in outreach strategies and how to
develop a program. The Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs has mandated that all
MVPC positions, which in the past were held by Cemetery Directors, be delegated to

19
",0,0,0,0
561,"another staff member so that more hours can be invested in outreach activities. The
Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs and Office of Field Programs leadership
participate quarterly in a NCA Minority Veterans Program briefing conducted by the
Deputy Director, CMV, and Senior Management Analyst of the CMV office. The Deputy
Under Secretary for Field Programs is working closely with regional leadership to
ensure that hours per month of outreach activities are increased. In the FY 2011- 2015
NCA Strategic Plan, a strategy has been added which addresses redesigning the NCA
Minority Veterans Program to ensure 90 percent of the reporting cemetery sites comply
with critical elements as defined by the VA Handbook 08071.
VBA has designated MVPCs at all regional offices to conduct outreach to minority
Veterans as part of their collateral duties. Outreach targeted to minority Veterans
remains a top priority. Each regional office has an action plan for targeted outreach that
requires MVPCs to conduct at least two town hall/stakeholders/Veterans Service
Organizations meetings annually. Within available resources, VBA will continue to work
toward the recommended outreach goals.

5. Develop and implement, based upon input from minority Veteran focus
groups, a culturally relevant communications strategy, by the end of FY 2011,
to promote awareness of VA benefits and services to targeted communities.
Rationale: Members of the ACMV have experienced, first-hand through site visits and
interaction with minority Veterans, the lack of a targeted communications strategy to
reach the minority communities defined in the charter of CMV. This lack of
communication has increased the chasm between minority Veterans and the majority
community resulting in many minority Veterans going unenrolled for VA services and
underserved by the Department. Members of the ACMV expressed the need to create
targeted messaging to ensure that all Veterans are aware of the services and benefits
afforded them, and how to connect with VA to receive these services. Additionally,
images, imagery and messaging needs to be developed to ensure Veterans from all
backgrounds are represented in the Department's communications strategy to include:
digital media, print media, online presence, etc.
Action Office: OPIA, VHA, VBA, NCA
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA agrees to develop and implement culturally relevant communication strategy;
however, developing and implementing a communication strategy may extend beyond
the end of FY 2011. In the MVPC Handbook, VAMCs are tasked to conduct at least two
town hall meetings each year. Minority Veterans at these town hall meetings are
22
",0,0,0,0
564,"provided various materials about VA benefits and health care services. Outreach
methods such as the town hall meetings are tools used to educate minority Veterans
and members of their community.
NCA continues the adaptation of One-VA support for minority Veterans’ interest at the
local community level. NCA, with the support of Veterans Service Organizations, affinity
associations, minority institution of higher education, and faith-based groups will
continue concentrating on improvements addressing the most apparent deficiencies and
realize opportunity to improve performance. NCA’s Office of Outreach has expanded its
efforts to promote awareness of VA benefits and services to various communities. In
FY 2010, NCA participated in sixty-six outreach events; and in FY 2011, we expect to
participate in eighty-eight efforts. In addition to the Outreach Office, the Veterans
Cemetery Grants Program staff participates in various outreach efforts to meet with
State Directors of Veteran Affairs and Tribal Government Officials at National Tribal
Government Conferences (e.g. National Congress of American Indians, United South
and Eastern Tribal, Inc., Tribal Veterans Service Organizations, and individual Tribes) to
promote the program and how VA, in its partnership, can assist in service to Veterans.
In June 2011, NCA selected a full-time National MVPC who is tasked with enhancing
the current MVPC program so that a greater awareness of NCA’s benefits and services
can be achieved.
VBA initiated a messaging campaign through the eBenefits portal that provides targeted
messages to Servicemembers and Veterans about specific benefits based on personal
and life-changing events. An example is messaging about the Native American Direct
Loan program.

6. That the Veterans Health Administration Office of Rural Health perform a
comprehensive needs assessment to determine the impact of transportation
barriers on the health of minority Veterans residing in rural, highly rural, and
frontier areas.
Rationale: A member of the Advisory Committee provided a comprehensive briefing on
the needs of the Veteran population in the Pacific Islands. A specific challenge in
accessing care is the distance between islands (traversed by costly and time-
consuming air transport): 1) Guam to Hawaii—3,820 miles; 2) Guam to America
Samoa—3,629 miles; and 3) Guam to Federal States of Micronesia—5/70 miles. The
issue of transportation is central to all outreach efforts and access to health care.
Utilization of health care tends to decrease as distance traveled increases.° In rural and
remote areas such as the Pacific Islands and tribal communities, transportation to and
from human services is woefully inadequate to overcome geographic barriers (long
distances, mountain ranges, hazardous conditions in inclement weather). According to
the VHA Office of Rural Health (ORH), 40% of American Indian/Alaskan Natives live on
geographically isolated and dispersed reservations or tribal lands resulting in significant
barriers to accessing quality care.’
For any outreach effort to succeed in eliminating disparities and healing patients, there
must be a means for providers and Veterans to interact face-to-face. The primary
mission in a patient-centric service is to bring the patient to the doctor or to bring the
doctor to the patient; otherwise accurate diagnosis of a medical condition cannot occur.

568,"o There is no locally based Wounded Warrior or Residential Post-traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (BTI) treatment program.
o Returning Veterans with chronic PTSD, TBI had to wait receiving service
connection category of at least 30% for the VA to cover transportation to
Hawaii, and this process takes up to six months.
o There are no providers for Agent Orange and other Specialty Exams.
o There is no Home-Based Primary Care Program.
o There is no Skilled Nursing Facility and Long-Term Care Community Living
Center.
o The recently constructed Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) is too
small to accommodate the number of Veterans seeking care.
To address these issues, VHA needs to allocate adequate resources and hire skilled
and qualified personnel. Collaborating with DoD to use space for Veterans within the
new Naval Hospital to be built on Guam may be one integrated solution.
e Space available in Veteran cemeteries is rapidly dwindling:
o The cemetery will be completely filled by 2012.
o No additional in-ground burials unless the coffin is oversized or it is a married
couple.
To address this issue, NCA needs funding to perform environmental and geological
testing on a new site immediately.
e Homeless Veterans: “Migrant” Veterans from off-island and on-island (homeless
Veterans and family going from family to family and staying with them) are increasing in
numbers.
It soon may be necessary to increase the number of vouchers for homeless Veterans to
accommodate the needs and use space from the soon to be built Naval Hospital.
2) Saipan
e Veterans face numerous challenges in accessing health care and benefits:
o VAhas rented a space for the Rural Outreach Clinic, but the facility has
neither personnel nor equipment (furniture, computers, etc.) in it.
o Veterans often must pay out-of-pocket to be seen on Guam for their service-
connected aliments. Itineraries are mailed but do not reach them on time.
o VA toll-free numbers do not work with the exception of 800-827-1000, so
Veterans cannot conveniently call for questions regarding health, GI Bill, or
Memorial Services.
Given these challenges, it is essential that the relevant VA offices collaborate to fully
evaluate the needs of minority Veterans in insular areas and develop an action plan to
close these aforementioned gaps.

ORH has developed and implemented action plans to increase access to VA programs
and facilities by expanding support and funding for telehealth services, through outreach
activities, community based outpatient clinic development and expansion, home-based
primary care program development, and transportation services. ORH has also
completed the Geographic Needs Assessments and the Health Care Needs
Assessments in all VISNs and continues to solicit input and information from rural and
highly rural Veterans through focus groups, town hall meetings and numerous outreach
activities, to better understand their needs and barriers to access.
VBA will collaborate with VHA to utilize the mobile Vet Centers for rural outreach. VBA
will also utilize eBenefits to provide greater access to Veterans who live in rural and
insular territories. VBA will determine the feasibility of using mobile Vet Centers and
their employees to register rural Veterans in eBenefits. Currently, VA has 50 mobile Vet
Centers to complement the 270 walk-in support Vet Centers.

Department's responsibility to provide the best care possible. Then Secretary of VA,
James Peake, stated the following during his remarks at the 2008 summit, “They
(Insular Areas) share in a somewhat unique representation of the difficult challenges of
rural health in general, complicated by the difficulties of island involvements. They have
relatively small populations in terms of density and, therefore, lack the economic clout to

expectations and the recognition of rising health care needs” (p. 29). The entire text of
Secretary Peake’s remarks is located on pages 29-31 of the report.
A recent study’’ examined perceptions of unmet health services needs among native
Puerto Rican OEF/OIF Veterans and family members post deployment. Results of the
qualitative study revealed that Veterans’ unmet needs included psychological
evaluations, mental health services, support groups, medical evaluations, and pain
treatment. Denial and stigma emerged as factors that deter Veterans from seeking
mental health treatment. The need for family support groups also emerged from the
data.

in accordance with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
National Partnership for Action (NPA) Plan to End Health disparities, inclusive
of holistic approaches to treating Veterans.
Rationale: On April 8, 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
rolled out the National Partnership for Action (NPA) National Stakeholder Strategy for
Achieving Health Equity and the HHS Action Plan for Reducing Health Disparities. This
roadmap for reducing health and health care disparities is a comprehensive effort to
address differences in health for racial, ethnic, and other underserved communities. VA
was represented on the NPA Federal Team, and as a stakeholder is required to
describe how the Department will address the strategies for achieving health equity and
eliminating disparities. The HHS Disparities Action Plan outlines goals, strategies, and
actions which will be taken to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic
minorities. The Disparities Action Plan builds on provisions of the Affordable Care Act
which helps to address the needs of racial and ethnic minority populations by bringing
down health care costs, investing in prevention and wellness, supporting improvements
in primary care and creating linkages between the traditional realms of health and social
services.'' VA is a major health care organization and should be involved in the
assessment and reduction of health care disparities within its facilities. According to a
VA study performed by Saha et. al. (2007), health disparities exist in all clinical areas of
the VA health care system and in studies examining quality indicators that represent
intermediate outcomes, non-white Veterans generally fared worse than white
Veterans. '* These findings were consistent with those reported by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality in 2003 from the general population and every year
thereafter. In addition, the VA study found that minority Veterans harbor less trust and
more skepticism about the benefits of medical interventions relative to their risks than
white Veterans. The report reflects that some African American Veterans in particular,
rely on religious and spiritual avenues for coping with illness as opposed to medical
therapies which are less culturally relevant.

With Veterans of all minority people groups, there are cultural differences within
each group that make delivery of information and services difficult at best because the
provider must be a trusted, culturally sensitive and understood healer. For minority
Veterans, this means using a holistic approach to healing that is culturally relevant to all
minority Veterans. What is relevant to white and foreign clinicians engender distrust
and skepticism in the minority culture that has more often than not been neglected by
the majority culture's business of healthcare that does not recognize the cultural
relevance of holistic healing.

573,"Finally, the VA study also suggests that clinicians’ diagnostic decision-making
varies by Veteran race."" Clinicians, medical and non-medical, are making diagnoses
and treatment decisions based on biases and stereotypes rather than measured
medical evidence interpreted by nurses and physicians. The cultures and belief
systems of minority Veteran patients have two common elements that are excluded by
the legal, scientific and current social/behavioral healthcare system. First, the authority
speaking must be speaking the truth with compassion and respect. Second, the
authority must be understood by the listener in the spirit. Minority groups have an
identity that is more spiritually based. This is the cord that ties diverse minority cultures
together. The locus of authority is Spirit and Truth rather than the clinicians and the
misunderstood messages of the healthcare business system that have been adopted.
Holistic healing beliefs and practices are a trusted reality in the cultures of minority
Veterans. Patient belief in information offered depends upon the authority and integrity
of the provider. If the process of every interaction does not value the whole person,
spirit, soul, mind and body, then there is incomplete healing. For these reasons, a
holistic approach to healing should become a part of the VHA Model of Patient-
Centered Care and Cultural Transformation.

Action Office: VHA (Responses to recommendations 9, 10, and 11 are combined. See
recommendation 11 for VA’s response. )
10. Establish an Office of Health Equity (OHE) similar to the Offices of Minority
Health (OMH) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The
OHE would incorporate the OMH mission of improving health outcomes
impacted by racial/ethnic differences, in addition to gender specific initiatives
currently the responsibility of the VA Office of Women’s Health (OWH), and
also focus on the possible effects on clinical outcomes due to Veterans’
sexual orientation.
Rationale: Although VHA has “concurred in principle” (2010 ACMV Report) with our
original recommendation to establish an Office of Minority Veteran Health, there has
been no presentation of the protocols that have been developed to address the health
and protection of racial/ethnic and sexual orientation needs in Veteran populations.
Furthermore, there was no presentation of the methods used to assess and ensure
equitable delivery of healthcare services.
The mission of this office would be to gather, interpret, and evaluate research, and to
develop health policies and programs to eliminate health disparities. This program may
also be included in patient-centered care to ensure that all Veterans particularly those
who experience disparities in care due to race/ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation
are receiving quality health care and positive health outcomes.

574,"A systematic review and synthesis of evidence from studies comparing health care
utilization and quality by race within VA was conducted by VA researchers.""* Their
results indicate: “Racial disparities in VA exist across a wide range of clinical areas and
service types. Disparities appear most prevalent for medication adherence; surgery and
other invasive procedures- processes that are likely to be affected by the quantity and
quality of patient-provider communication; shared decision making, and patient
participation. Studies indicate a variety of likely root causes of disparities including:
racial differences in patients’ medical knowledge and information sources, trust and
skepticism, levels of participation in health care interactions and decisions, and social
support and resources; clinician judgment/bias; the racial/cultural milieu of health care
settings; and differences in the quality of care at facilities attended by different racial
groups.” The researchers concluded that “existing evidence from the VA indicates
several promising targets for interventions to reduce racial disparities in the quality of
health care.”
Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PL 111-148 of 2010, the
HHS has received authorization and funding to establish six Offices of Minority Health
for the purpose of improving minority health and the quality of health care minorities
receive, and eliminating racial and ethnic disparities. Given the unique nature of the
health care and outreach needs of Veterans and their families, the VA should establish
an Office of Health Equity.
The review of existing programs and collaborations will not close the gap on disparities
in clinical services for minority Veterans. Actions must include establishment of
programs which acknowledge the disparity gap, and incorporate and implement robust
measures.
Action Office: VHA
11. Develop an action plan by the end of the first quarter of FY 2012 witha
goal of effecting a meaningful reduction in racial disparity among active
patients enrolled in the VA healthcare system. A pilot should focus on
reducing disparities in clinical outcomes such as blood pressure, glucose,
and cholesterol control, at VA healthcare facilities with high concentrations of
African American Veterans, as well as sites of high Hispanic/Latino, and
Native American/ Alaska Native populations.
Rationale: According to Jha et. al. (2010), 9 out of 150 VA hospitals (6% of all VA
hospitals) cared for nearly 30% of African American Veterans, and 42 hospitals (28% of
all VA hospitals) cared for more than 75% of African American Veterans.'° In the
decade following VA’s organizational transformation, the quality of care improved, and
racial disparities were minimal for most process-of-care measures. However, these

575,"improvements in clinical performance were not accompanied by meaningful reductions
in racial disparity for important clinical outcomes such as blood pressure, glucose, and
cholesterol control.""°
As affirmed by the Institute of Medicine, linking clinical performance measures to race
and ethnicity data can yield important insights for health care organizations seeking to
improve the quality and equity of their care. Because cardiovascular disease and
diabetes are major contributors to racial disparities in life expectancy, research studies
in health disparities highlight the need for immediate and focused efforts to improve
intermediate outcomes among black Americans in the VA and other health care
settings. ""’
In the course of developing this proposed action plan, VHA has a large amount of past
research to formulate initiatives as part of the action plan to reduce disparities. In spite
of this research however, most VA studies have examined differences between whites
and African Americans and have either excluded other groups or not included them in
sufficient numbers for meaningful analysis. As the VA patient population becomes more
diverse, it will be important to include sufficient numbers of Latinos and other minority
groups in future studies.""®
Action Office: VHA
VA Response: Concur-in-principle.
VA is constantly evaluating Veterans’ needs; new health care models to make access
more efficient and equitable; barriers to patient-centered access and outcomes; as well
as the quality of care and services provided. The Principal Deputy Under Secretary for
Health convened a Health Care Equality Work Group in June 2011, to address the
reasons for inequality in health care whether they are cultural, clinical, spiritual,
geographical, patient or provider, educational or related to other barriers for patients to
receive appropriate individualized health care with desired outcomes. Small sub groups
have been formed in targeted interest areas to ensure a broad view of issues, focused
recommendations, and implementation of recommendations occurs to improve
Veterans’ experience with the VHA health care system.
The goals of this Work Group are to develop a VA systematic approach to continuously
evaluate and communicate information related to equitable, Veteran-centric interactions
with VA’s health care system. The Work Group has begun to: 1) Review needs for
education and training at the professional, patient, and community levels to address
diverse and inclusive programs to benefit the Veteran population; 2) Evaluate

services and support systems; 3) Consult and review research literature and Veteran
experiences related to social and economic impacts on care including cultural, spiritual,
age and gender factors that affect Veteran experience with VA; 4) Convene
discussions with subject-matter experts on clinical practices effecting service delivery,
and capture data to better assess the needs of Veterans and provider satisfaction with
services for potential areas of inequity; 5) Evaluate geographic and environmental
factors regarding access and availability of health care in rural, highly rural, and other
communities including the potential of toxic environmental exposures; and 6) Will
provide initial recommendations in the form of a report to the Principal Deputy Under
Secretary for Health on the Work Group’s progress, further direction and deliverable
milestones for implementation of recommendations to VHA leadership including
enhancements or solutions to barriers for equitable health care and services delivery.
In 2011, VHA established several other initiatives to address disparities or inequality
including implementing a patient aligned care team model at all VA primary care sites to
enhance access, coordination, communication, and continuity of care for VA patients. A
key facet of this model is to identify factors in high-risk patient populations with complex
chronic medical problems to improve their health care and clinical outcomes. VA Is
making major investments to support patient health behaviors, including implementing
health risk assessment and culturally-sensitive behavioral counseling at all of our
facilities.
Also, because VA recognizes that healthy lifestyles are a function of whole communities
and not limited to the health care system, VA is investing in a national program of
telehealth that connects patients to their medical care teams outside of the traditional
face-to-face clinical visit. VA’s research program is providing a critical analysis of what
we know about disparities and efforts to reduce them. To advance VA's position as
national leaders in the campaign to address health disparities and inequalities, VA
prioritizes research in this area, supports Centers of Excellence focused on health
disparities research, and will explore strategies that can be implemented to improve
access, processes of care, clinical outcomes, and will also highlight community
partnerships that are needed to reduce disparities that lie beyond the health care
system.
VA created the Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation to develop
personal, patient-centered models of care for Veterans who receive health care services
at VA’s more than 1,000 points of care across the Nation. This will enhance VA’s ability
to continue as a national leader in innovation and showcase the future of high-quality
health care to our Veterans.
VA is committed to the transparency of quality and safety performance measures, and
in 2011, VA facilities began reporting comprehensive network and facility-level quality,
safety, and satisfaction data by race (minority versus non-minority) and gender. Current
comparison data for regional outcomes in key health areas can be found at VA's

12. Increase funding to collaborative partnerships, with Community Based
Organizations (CBOs) and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) that
provide assistance to homeless Veterans. This funding should enable more
mental health programs and supportive services for low income targeted
minority Veterans, regardless of gender in order to reduce minority Veteran
homelessness by 25% by the end of FY 2012.
Rationale: Although VA has made great progress in reducing homelessness,
minorities continue to be overrepresented among homeless Veterans’. In 2009, twice
aS many poor Hispanic Veterans used a shelter at some point during the year compared
with poor non-Hispanic Veterans, and African American Veterans in poverty had similar
rates of homelessness. Current estimates by the National Coalition for Homeless
Veterans (NCHV) suggest that roughly 56% of all homeless Veterans are African
American or Hispanic. Minority cultures do not look favorably on acknowledging mental
illness or seeking help and treatment for mental health. In fact, the stigma of mental
illness among some ethnic/racial minority groups may discourage people from seeking

579,"mental health care, medication, and counseling.~” Therefore, illnesses like PTSD may
be left untreated.
Given the disparate impacts of homelessness on minority Veterans, it is imperative that
VA ensures that the mental health programs and supportive services funded are
focused on the unique needs of homeless Veteran families, with a particular emphasis
on reintegration services, emergency shelters, and transitional housing for not only
homeless women Veterans with small children, but also for homeless male Veterans
with small children (considering the rising number of U.S. households with single
fathers). Hispanic, African-American, Asian, and Native American children are more
likely than Euro-American children to reside in single-father families.*' Although no U.S.
studies of the issues faced by single fathers were found, a study conducted in Australia
revealed that single fathers faced challenges similar to single mothers including the
need to leave situations of domestic violence to seek safety for their children, finding
and maintaining secure and flexible employment, accessing childcare, and most
importantly finding appropriate and affordable housing.“ In many cases, single fathers
experience biases and stereotypes and have even more difficulty accessing services
due to the untraditional nature of the household.
The VA should ensure that an integrated effort among the VHA, VBA, and OPIA be
taken to address the health needs of homeless minority Veterans who may need
ongoing and long-term care, particularly in the areas of mental health.
Action Offices: VHA, VBA and OPIA
VA Response: Concur
VHA has been working with community agencies to provide outreach and treatment
services to homeless Veterans for more than 20 years. VHA recognized that effectively
addressing the multiple needs of homeless Veterans rely on coordination of services
from multiple sources, including Community-Based Organizations and Non-government
organizations. In response to VHA’s commitment to these organizations, VA developed
the new Supportive Services for Veterans Families Program (SSVF), authorized by
Public Law 110-387. The SSVF program, recently passed and awarded, will award
grants totaling approximately $50 million to non-profit organizations and consumer
cooperatives providing supportive services to very low-income Veterans families by
providing a range of supportive services designed to promote housing stability.

580,"The number of minority homeless Veterans participating in VA’s specialized homeless
program are roughly consistent with those seen in the homeless Veteran population.
Specifically, in FY 2010, 48 percent of participants were White; 42 percent were African
American, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 3 percent were another ethnicity. Although no
significant changes in participation were evident among various ethnic groups over the
last 5 years, clinical data suggests a gradual decrease in the participation of African
American Veterans (from 46 percent to 42 percent). Conclusively, the SSVF program,
along with VA’s extensive array of other homeless Veterans and mental health
programs, should address the needs identified, while playing a critical role in VA’s plan
to end homelessness among Veterans.
VHA has primary responsibility for funding allocated for homeless and low-income
Veterans. VBA will continue to collaborate with VHA to assist minority Veterans and
minority Veterans at-risk of homelessness through referrals and coordination.

can pay to have them returned to the States.

- Adult-unwed daughters can be buried in these cemeteries.

- Veterans have a burial option in every State in the Union.

- 90% of the Veterans will have a burial option.

Veterans Health Administration Briefing/Update (Deputy Under Secretary)

- Secretary’s 3 main priorities: healthcare access, reduce backlog VBA claims,
end homelessness.

- Discussed health care, driving long distances and access.

- Telehealth, barely scratching the surface. This is a huge initiative for VHA.

o There is a greater demand in serving Veterans in rural areas.
- Need to train their providers and learn best practices — Veteran by Veteran —
learn what the Veteran needs.
QUESTION: What is the most pressing challenge?
ANSWER: Old infrastructures/maintaining old buildings — getting assets located where
there is growth, getting medical centers in the right places, budget deficits, the
economy, etc. We do not understand or respond to culture effectively. VHA needs to
44
",0,0,0,0
586,"take one Veteran group at a time (African American, Asian, Hispanic, Native American,
etc).
QUESTION: What is VHA doing to increase the sensitivity of their providers?
ANSWER: Need to be Veteran/Patient-centric — have Veterans/Patients take charge of
their care.
The Committee encouraged/recommended that the speaker/VHA Leadership in the field
support their Minority Veterans Program Coordinators and request an update of their
outreach efforts to get an understanding of what these MVPCs have to deal with in
providing outreach to Veterans in their areas.
Life is Power that Heals (Committee Member)
Provided briefing/handouts on topic - “physical injury of brain memory is the problem,
power that heals is the only solution.”
Veterans Population in the Pacific Islands (Committee Member)
Provided a briefing on the challenges and conditions of Veterans residing in the Pacific
Islands and available programs and services.
Paws for Purple Hearts Program Video (Recent OEF/OIF Committee Member)
Dogs in training learn about 99 different commands to assist Veterans with activities of
daily living.
Veterans Benefits Administration (Principal Duty Under Secretary of Benefits)
VAs’ goals include:

- Nocase over 125 days and the SECVA goal is 98% accuracy rate

- Goal to go completely paperless

- Current accuracy rate is 84-85%
QUESTION: How are the adjudicators held accountable in overlooking critical evidence
for claim and causing the delay?
ANSWER: Adjudicators need to build trust to go out and ask for assistance in obtaining
records. Veterans have to request civilian records if they see a physician in the
community and this takes time. We are trying to do away with this by building a
complete record. VBA is building communication and engendering trust. VA must
make sure we recognize the digital and economic divide. Generational divide as it
relates to technology. WWII Vets prefers a phone call.
QUESTION/COMMENT: Still hasn't heard how the adjudicator overcomes issues that
are common sense (i.e. lost records). How are you factoring time line for appeals? If

45
",0,0,0,0
587,"there are three or more issues, one or more are denied. Then the Veteran comes back
to file appeal which becomes part of the backload.

ANSWER: In overhauling new practice will simply call the Veteran instead of waiting
the 60 days. Not able to answer all questions, however we addressing these type of
ISSues.

QUESTION: How do you promote diversity and grow minorities to become leaders.
ANSWER: Effort and energy is put into junior employees (GS-12-13) to groom. 50% of
the VBA workforce has been with VBA for 5 years. Promote training and opportunities
of advancement. We were also successful in recruiting young people out of college.
COMMITTEE MEMBERS’ COMMENTS:

- Select the best and brightest. You must use different rules in selection of
minorities because they have never been valued and viewed in this way.
Cultural Competency is important.

- Diversity is important for an organization. The organization should reflect the
diversity of the community for which we live in to ensure every ethnic group is
represented.

- Minorities live in the shadow of towering contradictions. When you look at the
number, in order to move the needle you must confront the contradictions.

- Inclusion breeds opportunity. Concentrate on inclusion. Among minorities it
peak’s out at GS-8 (in VBA). Hope that you are including HBCU’s, HACU, and
Tribal colleges in your recruitment efforts.

QUESTION: How do you monitor regions with high error rates?
ANSWER: 57 RO’s and we monitor their quality and provide detailed training - 80
hours. Training provided is performance based. If specific errors are noticed they will
go back and review. We are very detailed on quality and review. How can we do
better with quality? By automation, with technology we can get a boost in quality using
technology. We must build trust and confidence among the Veterans.
COMMITTEE EX-Officio MEMBER (DoD): We are standing up a C&P office that is a
part of their examination. This will be their job.
COMMITTEE MEMBER: Recommended the Speaker take a look at VA Form 21-0760
with reference to Post 9-11 GI Bill, Vocational Rehabilitation and other VA benefits to
see if there is a disparity among the minority Veteran population. Also requested that
VBA provide data regarding utilization of these benefits by minority Veterans.

Town Hall Meeting
Wednesday, April 6, 2011
Background

A Veterans Town Hall Meeting was held for the purpose of hearing Veterans,
family members, and survivors’ concerns, answering questions, and providing
information concerning current initiatives underway by local VA facilities. VA leadership
from the Washington DC VA Medical Center and Washington VA Regional Office, along
with a representative from the Office of the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs joined
ACMV members on the panel during the duration of the Veterans Town Hall Meeting.
Approximately 150 Veterans and other stakeholders were in attendance. We also were
provided on-site support through the efforts of staff from AARP, Maryland Health Care
System Veterans Center van, and the Minority Veterans Program Coordinator from the
Washington, DC VA Medical Center. The majority of the Veterans in attendance were
Vietnam Era Veterans, with the remainder being Cold War and Korean War Era. There
were very few Veterans from the current conflicts in attendance. Many of these
Veterans rely on written letters, face-to-face and telephone contact to secure the
information they need from the VA.
Town Hall Meeting Observations
The common themes addressed during this session were as follows:

e Many Veterans were not clear as to the current status of their claims. Some
were aware of the E-Benefits system, but most rely on telephone calls and
letters for information.

e Veterans did not have a clear understanding of the appeals process and the
evidence required to grant an increase in benefits.

e Veterans expressed frustration about the lack of accurate information they
received from VA representatives by phone

e Veterans were frustrated with the delays encountered processing their claims.

e Advocates for homeless Veterans felt that increased emphasis based on
priority was required on processing claims for homeless Veterans.

e Veterans needed assistance to properly file their claims.

e Veterans were not adequately aware of assistance available from various
Veterans advocates within and external to the VA.

e Clarification was requested concerning accommodations that could be made
for funeral arrangements based on religious and cultural preferences.

e Several Veterans expressed their appreciation for services received at VA
facilities.

51
",0,0,0,0
593,"The themes addressed during the Veterans Town Hall Meeting demonstrate an
ongoing need for each VA Administration to incorporate outreach as part of its mission.
Veterans already utilizing VA benefits and services inform VA how it is doing via
customer satisfaction surveys. The vast majority of Veterans are not constant users of
VA benefits and services. Some of this is due to the fact that the past use of education
and home guarantee benefits satisfied their needs at the time used. In many cases,
Veterans do not discuss the benefits that are due with family members and spouses.
Sadly, in many cases, when a Veteran expires, survivors are not aware of burial
benefits for the Veteran, and survivor benefits that the spouse may receive. The
minority Veteran population historically experiences challenges meeting financial and
health issues. It is essential that public information and outreach services are provided
to all Veterans, their families, and survivors to increase access to VA benefits and
services during time of need.

1. Access

- ACMV requested clarification on eligibility/access for transportation for blind

612,"Part I. ACMV 2012 Recommendations and Rationales
Recommendation #1: The Veterans of Insular Areas of the Pacific (Guam, Samoa,
etc.) have the option of receiving specialty care in the Philippines rather than at
the Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii.
Rationale #1: During every town hall meeting held in Guam, the following question
continued to be asked; “Why can't our Veterans use the VA Medical Facility in the
Philippines?” The travel distance between Guam and Hawaii is 3,820 miles or 8 hours
of flight time versus between Guam and the Philippines is 1,534 miles or 3 hours of
flight time. All costs (airfare, hotel, food, etc.) associated for the Veterans and
accompanying family members to the Philippines are less expensive than going to
Hawaii. This option would be a tremendous cost savings for VA. Additionally, the
population of aging Veterans requiring additional health care is rising in insular areas;
thereby, straining Hawaii's already over-burdened healthcare system. The situation will
only worsen with the addition of new OEF/OIF Veterans residing in these areas.
In the U.S. code of Federal Regulations, Title 38, subsection 17.35 titled Hospital Care
and Medical Services in Foreign Countries, it states “The Secretary may furnish hospital
care and medical services to any Veteran sojourning or residing outside the United
States, without regard to the Veteran's citizenship.” It would seem logical and optimum
to add a provision that Veterans of insular areas be afforded the opportunity to receive
off-island referral hospital care and medical services in the Philippines and not only in
Hawaii, as current policies dictate. Specifically for:

1. Outpatient medical services at the Manila Department of Veterans Affairs

Clinic; and if needed,

2. Hospital care at St. Luke Medical Hospital
We are not advocating to replace the VA’s existing off-island referral system to Hawaii
with ones to the Philippines. Rather, we are advocating that VA add the option for off-
island referrals (both outpatient medical services and hospital care) to the Philippines,
as this location has definite advantages of lesser travel time, transportation/lodging and
perhaps per-diem requirements and personal costs to accompanying family members
for eligible Veterans of insular areas.
VA Response: Non-concur
VA has limited authority to provide hospital care or medical services outside the United
States, and special eligibility requirements apply for VA’s Manila Outpatient Clinic in the
Philippines. In general, VA may provide hospital care or medical services to certain
Veterans who are “sojourning or residing outside the United States.” 38 U.S.C. §
1724(b)(1); 38 C.F.R. § 17.35. Such hospital care or medical services must be
necessary for treatment of a service-connected (SC) disability or a “disability associated
with and held to be aggravating a” SC disability. 38 C.F.R. § 17.35/(a).

4
",0,0,0,0
613,"Hospital care or medical services may also be furnished outside the United States to
Veterans participating in a rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 who
require “care for the reasons enumerated in 38 C.F.R. § 17.47(i)(2).” Id. at § 17.35(b).
In addition, separate eligibility requirements apply to VA’s Manila Outpatient Clinic in the
Philippines. The Clinic may furnish medical services to Veterans with a SC disability
who are residing in, or visiting, the Philippines. 38 U.S.C. § 1724(e).
ACMV recommends that eligible Veterans who reside in Guam, or other insular islands,
should be able to receive referrals to the Philippines in addition to Hawaii. Because
Guam is considered to be part of the United States, care and services provided to these
Veterans in Hawaii would not be subject to limitations on care furnished outside the
United States. Any care provided to these Veterans in the Philippines (outside VA’s
Manila Outpatient Clinic) is, however, subject to the statutory and regulatory limitations
on care furnished outside the United States discussed above. If a Veteran with a SC
disability were to visit or reside in the Philippines, he or she may be able to utilize the
services of the Clinic.
VA’s Beneficiary Travel regulations allow VA to “make payments for travel expenses
incurred in the United States” only. 38 C.F.R. § 70.1(a). The beneficiary travel
regulations define the “United States” as the “States, Territories, and possessions of the
United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”
38 C.F.R. § 70.2. Provision of beneficiary travel outside of these areas, including the
Philippines, would require regulatory change.
Although the travel time between Guam and other insular islands to Hawaii is lengthy,
Veterans can access the complete VA medical benefits package in Hawaii compared to
limited care available at the VA Clinic in the Philippines. Consequently, we do not
concur with the ACMV’s recommendation.
Recommendation #2: The Office of Health Equity (OHE) conduct ongoing
monitoring of the effect cultural competence training has on patient satisfaction
scores, patient compliance with clinical treatment plans, clinical outcomes, and
establish best practices based on this evaluation.
Rationale #2: Patient satisfaction scores can be utilized to develop a baseline prior to
conducting cultural competency training. After cultural competency training has been
conducted, follow up patient satisfaction survey results and a comparison to previous
clinical outcome results can be reviewed to determine if training enhanced outcomes.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
Currently, patient satisfaction scores cannot be linked with individual providers or linked
to cultural competency training. Furthermore, there are numerous confounding
variables to link an improvement, maintenance, or decrease in patient satisfaction
scores at a facility to any one specific intervention.

614,"Various articles speak to the issues of cultural competency of health care providers.
The September 2011 Health Services Research and Development Evidence-Based
Synthesis Report “Interventions to Improve Minority Health Care and Reduce Racial
and Ethnic Disparities” states, “[t]here is good evidence that cultural competence
interventions can improve provider knowledge, attitude and skills, but there are few
good quality studies of effects on patient outcomes.” This view was also supported by
the October 16, 2012, Journal of General Internal Medicine article “Does Cultural
Competency Training of Health Professional Improve Patient Outcomes? A Systematic
Review and Proposed Algorithm for Future Research.”
In FY 2013, the OHE in partnership with the Center for Health Equity Research and
Promotion will develop and run a pilot intervention to test the associations of cultural
competency/unconscious bias training on select provider and patient outcomes. The
results of this pilot will inform the feasibility and acceptability of such provider training
and the impact of such training on select provider and patient outcomes. Demonstration
of feasibility and preliminary associations between such trainings and more favorable
provider and patient outcomes will serve as useful pilot data to develop more definitive
hypothesis driven experimental studies to inform future evidence-based cultural
competency/unconscious bias training interventions focused on providers.
Recommendation #3: The ACMV recommends that as part of routine clinical
assessments, VA clinical providers review the treatment provided to patients with
long term diagnosis (problem list item) of PTSD to ensure they have received
treatment for that illness within the last two years.
Rationale #3: During the course of site visits and informal discussions with the
Veterans it became apparent that some Veterans in receipt of disability compensation
for PTSD are not receiving periodic assessments and treatment for their PTSD service-
connected disabilities. This is especially critical for Vietnam era Veterans as they enter
retirement and no longer have the structure responsibilities of a job to divert their focus.
During the recent site visit in Texas, Veterans stated that they began to have more
thoughts about their combat experiences once they left their jobs. Monetary
compensation for their PTSD is important. However, mental health follow up is also
essential.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
Veterans with PTSD can be treated in specialized PTSD services, general Mental
Health Services, or primary care. Many Veterans living with chronic but stable PTSD
are treated in primary care via Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT). PACTs perform
periodic PTSD assessments to ensure that latent PTSD symptoms are detected.
For PTSD exacerbations, the primary care provider can evaluate and treat within the
PACT, conduct a “warm handoff” to Primary Care Mental Health Integration staff
embedded within the primary care clinic, or formally refer to Mental Health Specialty
services. The PACT provider determines a suitable evaluation and treatment approach
meeting the needs and expectations of each Veteran. Long-term mental health follow-
6
",0,0,0,0
615,"up is not necessary or appropriate for all Veterans living with this syndrome. Facilities
provide oversight to ensure that these assessments and ongoing evaluations are
performed.
Recommendation #4: Incorporate “current design solutions” to include Planetree
design, privacy, and family friendly components found in Department of Veterans
Affairs, Office of Construction and Facilities Management (VA OCFM) Interior
Design Manual for New Construction and Renovations of Hospital and Clinics,
2008 into the Minimum Standards for CBOC Operations, in VHA Handbook 1006.1,
Paragraph 6.
Rationale #4: VHA Handbook 1006.1 does not include “current design solutions’ in
the Minimum Standards for CBOC Operations. However, it does reflect that “Veterans
receive one standard of care at all VHA health care facilities; care at CBOCs must be
consistent, safe, and of high quality, regardless of model (VA-staffed or contract”). The
VA Interior Design Manual states that “Interior Design is a major component in
establishing and maintaining an environment that is professional, therapeutic, safe,
aesthetically pleasing, and functionally appropriate.” During the site visit to San
Antonio, Texas, it became clear to the Committee that the South Bexar CBOC had
clearly outgrown its current facility. There is a plan to move the clinic as soon as space
can be found. The new facility along with others in the VA system should reflect an
acceptable Environment of Care (EOC) with respect to visual and auditory privacy and
space needs of the current patient population seen by the CBOC, as well as projected
populations of younger Veterans with small children wno may need a more family-
friendly facility.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
Currently, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Handbook 1006.1 entitled, “Planning
and Activating Community-Based Outpatient Clinics” does not include “current design
solutions” in the minimum standards for CBOCs. VHA supports one standard where all
VHA health care facilities are safe; constructed using high quality materials; and
maintain an environment that is professional, therapeutic, aesthetically pleasing, and
functionally appropriate regardless of the facility. VHA is conducting ongoing
discussions into the future design of various health care facilities, including CBOCs. VA
is unable to state at this time how the “current design solution” will be incorporated into
a directive or handbook until after the findings are reviewed, analyzed, and reported to
leadership.

616,"Recommendation #5: The Office of Health Equity (OHE) monitor the utilization of
the VA Caregiver Program with the goal of ensuring that the utilization of the
program by Veterans and their family members is reflective of the demographics
of the Veteran population (race/ethnicity, gender, rural, highly rural, period of
service, etc.).
Rationale #5: The ACMV appreciates the significant efforts and progress made in the
VHA’s efforts to implement the VA Caregiver Program in accordance with Public Law
111-163, “Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010.” Of
particular note, is the VHA’s delivery of training in Puerto Rico in Spanish with the
assistance of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health (NAHH). However, given the
unique cultural factors of minority Veterans and access issues for those in rural areas, it
is imperative that VHA develop outcome measures to monitor use of this critical benefit
by Family Caregivers of minorities, women, and rural Veterans to ensure equitable
access for those Veterans eligible. Ensuring equitable access to this benefit will enable
severely injured minority Veterans to have improved quality of care from their Family
Caregivers, and help Family Caregivers manage the caregiver burden by accessing not
only financial support but also mental health counseling, respite services, and valuable
self-care information.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
The Caregiver Support Program Office is the preferred office to take the lead to track
the utilization of the program by Veterans and their family members to ensure that
actual use of the program is reflective of the population served. The Caregiver Support
Office will collaborate with OHE, CMV, and the Office of Health Analytics to monitor

Recommendation #6: The VA Caregiver Support website
http://www.caregiver.va.gov, Support materials such as fact sheets describing
eligibility criteria and benefits, and Caregiver program satisfaction surveys
should be translated into Spanish and other languages based on need by the end
of 1st Quarter 2013 to ensure that non-English speaking Family Caregivers have
access to this information and can provide feedback on the program.
Rationale #6: An organization that makes it easier for people to navigate, understands,
and uses information and services to take care of their health is defined as a health
literate organization. A key attribute of the health literate organization is that it designs
and distributes print, audiovisual, and social media content that is easy to understand
and act on include using quality translation to produce materials in languages other than
English. VHA’s efforts to translate the Family Caregiver training into Spanish and
deliver it several times in Puerto Rico are commendable. However, given the rising
number of Hispanics in the U.S. and the rising number of Hispanic Veterans, it is
important to ensure that all Family Caregiver resources are translated. In a study of
Hispanic caregivers, more than seven in ten think it is very or somewhat important for
them personally to have any caregiver information in Spanish. Among those born in the
U.S., half feel Spanish language materials would be very or somewhat important.
Studies confirm that health literacy impacts health knowledge, health status, and access
to health services. Low health literacy is more prevalent among minority populations
and minorities typically underutilize health and social services for caregivers, including
mental and behavioral health services. This occurs for several reasons including limited
English proficiency which inhibits learning about caregiver resources and
communication about caregiver and recipient status. Access to health information
should not unnecessarily burden the severely injured Veteran who has to translate this
information for the non-English speaking Family Caregiver.

(VARO) as the model for Claims Transformation “Express Lanes” Processing
Program throughout Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA).
Rationale #7: In FY 2011, the Houston Veterans Service Center (VSC) received
38,024 disability claims, which was a significant decrease of 10% from FY 2010
(42,379) claims. To date, the total number of claims received this fiscal year is 17,752,
which is a monthly average of 2,958 claims. Houston VARO has implemented the
Transformation Model that utilizes the three segmented processing lanes of: Express,
Core, and Special Operations. This model has allowed the Houston VARO to complete
Express Lane cases In less than 125 days, as compared to approximately 300 days in
the other two lanes. By comparison, the national average of processing disability claims
is 238.8 days. The Houston VARO transformation initiative maximized employee
potential by placing them in the lane that best suited their specific skills. Technological
advances are also helping to ensure that systems support expedited, paperless claims
processing. These initiatives, overall, reflect an aggressive approach by an innovative
and energetic team at the Houston VARO in accordance with the goals of the Secretary.
VA Response: Concur
VBA incorporated best practices developed in Indianapolis, Houston, and other ROs to

Recommendation #8: VA officials from the three Administrations should ensure
that Veteran’s demographic data made available from local VA Minority Veterans
Program Coordinators (MVPCs) is utilized by local individuals conducting
outreach to conduct targeted outreach to all identified ethnic Veteran populations
in their catchment areas.
Rationale #8: During the recent site visit in Texas, it was noted that additional outreach
opportunities with Native American, and Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans in the
local catchment areas did exist.
VA Response: Concur
MVPCs in the 57 regional offices extract the latest census data on minority population
within their catchment area to provide both focused and targeted outreach to minority
Veterans identified. The MVPC also partners with local minority organization to conduct
outreach to Veterans’ family members and survivors within those identified catchment
area. The MVPCs at the ROs further partners with their VHA counterparts to provide
more comprehensive outreach to minority populations including Native American and
Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans in their local communities. A monthly status
report as well as the quarterly reports of outreach to minority Veterans would provide
necessary data to RO Directors allowing the MVPC to conduct more focused outreach
by concentrating on those areas identified in the report.
As a standard procedure since FY 2007, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA)
has utilized the full soectrum of Veterans’ demographical data available from the both
the Census Bureau and VA’s own data systems as a primary method to increase
contact with minority Veterans. Since FY 2007, NCA’s Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) Office has sponsored training on how to best extract demographical data from
the VHA Service Support Center (VSSC). All NCA Cemetery Directors, MVPCs, MSN
Directors, and Human Resources (HR) Liaisons are trained where the information is
located and how to retrieve it and are reminded to make full utilization of the data at
every opportunity. Ms. Juanita Mullen, who is the American Indian Veterans Liaison at

NCA continues to participate in events specifically targeting Native American and Asian
American/Pacific Islander Veterans nationwide; during outreach events, participants are
informed of the services and benefits provided to Veterans and their families by NCA.
Some of the outreach events in the Texas area that NCA has participated in this fiscal
year include: Heroes and Heritage Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012; Fort Sam
Houston, San Antonio, Texas; League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)
National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012; Hilton Houston Oak, Houston, Texas;

Recommendation #9: VA regional administrators should monitor staff
recruitment efforts with a goal of hiring staff that are diverse and reflective of the
Veteran population.
Rationale #9: There are approximately 10,000 Native American Veterans and 12,000
Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans in the Texas area, therefore special emphasis
should be placed on targeting recruitment efforts to increase the employment of
Veterans of these ethnicities. Few individuals of these ethnic backgrounds are currently
employed by the VA in the Texas area.
VA Responses: Concur-in-principle and Concur
VBA Response: Concur-in-principle
VBA is very proactive in recruiting and monitoring the diversity of our workforce.
Currently, 50.1 percent of the workforce has Veteran status, and 39.9 percent of the
workforce is represented by minority demographics (i.e., African American, Asian,
16
",0,0,0,0
625,"Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, etc). Nationwide, VBA currently
employs 66 Asian/Pacific Islanders and 48 Native Americans. Of those two minority
groups, the Texas VA Regional Offices (Waco and Houston) employ 30 of these
employees. There are no VBA hiring authorities that specifically target the Asian/Native
American/Pacific Islander population. VA does offer temporary student internships
through its National Diversity Internship Program (NDIP). NDIP recruits interns through
organizations that conduct targeted outreach to diverse student populations.
VBA participates in a multitude of outreach, recruitment, and hiring events that focus on
Veterans’ representative of the minority demographic. For example, during FY 2011,
the Waco RO's Human Resource Management Liaison and a Human Resources
Management Specialist participated in the National Multicultural Job Expo at Texas
State University in San Marcos. Minority students throughout the Nation were invited to
attend the expo. The Waco RO recruiting is conducted through the Office of Personnel
Management's USAJOBS Web site, college and university career services Web sites,
local Texas Workforce Commission Web sites, and VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and
Employment Program.
VHA, NCA, and ODI Responses: Concur
The Healthcare Retention and Recruitment Office (HRRO), Recruitment Marketing and
Advertising (RMA) division works to ensure that a comprehensive plan is in place to
reach out to diverse healthcare professionals and Veterans, emphasizing outreach to
underrepresented communities in our professional workforce. In addition, HRRO’s
National Recruitment Program (NRP) places Veteran healthcare recruiters in each VISN
nationwide who collaborate with military transition groups locally and participate in
Veteran career events in their regions (including the recent VA for Veterans national
hiring events). The RMA and NRP work together to adjust the national marketing and
outreach strategies as needed to effectively reach targeted communities.
The VHA Applicant Tracking System, an online database which allows VHA recruiters to
share potential candidates and track their recruitment process, is undergoing a software
update which will allow for more detailed reporting functions. As part of that update,
HRRO will be able to track the number of candidates linked to specific diversity
initiatives and follow up on those candidates’ status in the recruitment process. By
tracking leads by recruitment source, the overall marketing plan can be adjusted based
on the effectiveness of specific recruitment functions and advertising at reaching diverse
Veteran candidates to serve our diverse Veteran patient population.
As a part of the MVPCs normal outreach duties, they provide Veterans a copy of NCA’s
brochure with information on how to apply for employment opportunities at NCA. In
FY 2012, NCA offices nationwide have participated in several outreach events
specifically targeting Native American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander
Veterans. As a practice, NCA utilizes these opportunities for recruitment to further
diversify the workforce as well as increasing minority participation in the services and
benefits that we provide. Some of the measures NCA has taken to improve Native

serving as guest speakers at events focusing on outreach and recruitment of these
targeted groups, including the White House Asian American Pacific Islander
Roundtable, and the Tribal Governments Consultation in Washington, DC.
In addition, NCA has participated in outreach at events in Texas such as the Heroes
and Heritage Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio,
Texas, and the LULAC National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012, Hilton
Houston Oak, Houston, Texas. Through NDIP, NCA provides opportunities for students
from the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), the Asian Pacific American
Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS), and the International Leadership
Foundation (ILF) to gain Federal job experience for ten weeks. This program serves as
a very useful long range recruiting tool. In FY 2012, several of the NDIP interns were
obtained through Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) outreach.
NCA has established partnerships with the ILF, APAICS, and OCA to sponsor students
throughout the year at various cemetery locations nationwide.
The Veterans Cemetery Grants Program conducts quarterly conference calls and e-
mails program updates to state cemeteries and other organizations about pending
grants. Individual conference calls have been conducted with Hawaii and Guam
providing guidance on their pending project; this initiative ensures funding and
additional employment opportunities for Asian American/Pacific Islander communities.

Recommendation #10: VBA should consider dedicating regional staff to review
applications for the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program to ensure that lenders are
not charging Veterans unauthorized fees.
Rationale #10: The Houston VA Regional Office (VARO) covers three states
(Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana) and utilized five employees to conduct audits of
Veterans home loan transactions. This led to the RO returning more than $103,000 in
unauthorized fees back to Veterans. This process led to the VARO providing training to
these companies so they do not continue to collect these un-authorized fees.
VA Response: Non-concur
VBA does not concur with this recommendation at this time because we already have a
thorough oversight process in place to identify unallowable/unauthorized fees to
Veterans. Currently, Regional Loan Centers (RLC) audit 10 percent of all loan files and
100 percent of early default loans by conducting full loan file reviews. During this
review, HUD-1 forms are examined to ensure Veterans were not erroneously charged
unallowable/unauthorized fees. Additionally, VBA’s Loan Guaranty Service has a
Lender Monitoring Unit (LMU) that audits loans on-site at lenders’ offices and at the
LMU's office in Nashville, Tennessee. These audits ensure compliance with VA
requirements, including an examination of fees.
The referenced Houston RLC pilot program differed in the current process only by
formerly tracking the total fees of the files reviewed on a spreadsheet. Other RLCs do
not currently capture this specific data electronically but provide a summary view of the
findings for lenders to address. Loan Guaranty Service staff is developing an initiative
that would capture fee information and other critical data elements electronically, which
will allow staff to realize a more robust reporting capability to address identified trends
with specific lenders. Therefore, VBA believes it is best to complete the data initiative
and perform analysis to best determine how to further ensure that Veterans are not
charged unallowable/unauthorized fees. It is also important to note that currently all
RLCs offer training to lenders who are found to be deficient to ensure future
compliance, and the LMU also monitors and addresses deficiencies with lenders.

631,"Recommendation #11: The VISN 17 Network Veteran Advocate Initiative is an
outstanding example of the Department of Veterans Affairs of how the VA strives
to be People Centric, Results Driven, and Forward Looking. This regionally
directed program should be adopted by the VA as a best practice and utilized
throughout the Department.
Rationale #11: In VISN 17, Network Veteran Advocates work for the Network Director
to advocate on behalf of Veterans and their families. These motivated and diverse
individuals operate as a team, led by the Network PAO and Congressional/VSO liaison.
They are on call around the clock to respond to Veteran’s needs and spend their time
on the following priorities:

o Advocacy

o Outreach

o Caregiver support

o Homeless assistance

o Veterans justice

o Social services
The team has experience in both legal and clinical areas, as well as extensive
knowledge of benefits available at the federal, state, and local level for Veterans and
military retirees. These individuals augment the assistance that is traditionally provided
by patient advocates and social workers in the VA healthcare system. These dedicated
individuals spend the majority of their time traveling to locations where Veterans and
their family members reside to provide assistance, instead of working in their offices
where Veterans and their family members have to come to them. The mission of these
individuals and their operational alignment under a key individual on the VISN Director's
Staff is a perfect example of targeted outreach.
http://www.heartoftexas.va.gov/VetAdvocate.asp
VA Responses: Concur-in-principle
The VISN 17 Network Veteran Advocate Initiative, which advocates on behalf of
Veterans and their families, is one of a number of ways VA reaches out to Veterans and
their family members. VA is making a concerted effort to let Veterans know that we are
here to serve them and provide outstanding health care and benefits. We are getting
this message out to Veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan through our
“Seven Touches” approach, in which we contact Veterans in seven different ways from
the day they enlist to the day they are demobilized and post-deployment.
We are reaching out to rural Veterans through the Office of Rural Health. We have
increased the number of our CBOCs — from 700 CBOCs 4 years ago to over 800 today.
Also, we have increased the number of Vet Centers during that time. We put a large
fleet of mobile Vet Centers on the road to bring VHA counselors to rural Veterans. VA
is providing home-based primary care; reaching out with technology in the form of
telehealth and teleradiology care; establishing telehealth activities in every VISN;

23
",0,0,0,0
632,"providing premiere mental health care for Veterans; and treating more patients, more
effectively every year. These accomplishments demonstrate our commitment to
Veterans.
VBA agrees that the Network Veteran Advocate Initiative is an outstanding example of
VA’s goal of being people-centric, results-driven, and forward-looking. However, VBA
doubts the feasibility of a comprehensive nationwide program that integrates all three
Administrations in the absence of a department operational alignment.
NCA is uniquely configured in comparison to the other Administrations at VA. NCA is
relatively small, approximately 1,700 employees, and our Table of Distribution and
Allowances (TDA) does not allow for the positions noted in the rationale for ACMV
recommendation #11. However, NCA continues to implement strategies that are
closely aligned with recommendation #11.
NCA’s vision is to be the model of excellence for burial and memorials for our Nation’s
Veterans and their families. To achieve this vision, NCA is engaged in a
comprehensive study to better understand the needs and preferences of Veterans with
respect to their burial and memorial needs today and in the years to come. In
November 2011, NCA and its contractor Booz Allen Hamilton completed an extensive
examination of new and emerging burial and memorial practices around the world that
are not currently offered by NCA, but might be appropriate to offer Veterans and their
families in the future.
Currently, NCA is conducting number of activities where Veterans can share their
satisfaction with current VA/NCA burial and memorial offerings and offer their opinions
about which, if any, new burial and memorial options Veterans might want VA/NCA to
offer at national cemeteries in the future. Understanding and meeting the burial and
memorial needs of minority Veterans, especially Native American/Alaskan and Muslim
American Veterans a is a key to ensuring that Veterans as a whole are satisfied with the
burial and memorial benefits available to them through VA. Native American/Alaskan
Veterans join America’s Armed Forces in the largest per capita numbers compared to
any other group and Muslim American Veterans are the fastest growing group of
Veterans today.
NCA and Booz Allen Hamilton plan to reach out to these groups through several
upcoming meetings and conferences to obtain a better understanding of the burial
needs and expectations of these important Veteran populations. Staff from NCA's
Policy and Planning Service in Washington, DC, attended the recent Southwest Region
Training Summit conducted by VA's Office of Tribal Government Relations (OTGR) in
Norman, Oklahoma. At the summit, they conducted two ""listening sessions"" with
American Indian Tribal leaders to hear about their burial traditions and their
expectations when selecting burial at a national cemetery. Additional sessions, in
collaboration with OTGR, were planned for summer and fall.

customer satisfaction that NCA is rated as well as the reality that NCA continues to
have the highest level of Veteran employees of any agency in the Federal sector.
NCA’s workforce is comprised of more than 70 percent Veterans; “Veterans Serving
Veterans’ is an inherent contributor to its continued success in customer service. NCA
has exceeded the Secretary’s goal of 40 percent Veteran employment at VA as noted in
a memorandum dated, July 31, 2012, for over 10 years. This commitment to our
Veteran population starts with the assurance of NCA leaders and is accomplished by
dedicated employees who clearly understand their duty to Veterans is to provide them
with the best service possible.
In FY 2012, NCA has continued employing initiatives to uphold these standards by
hiring a bilingual employee at the scheduling office to better serve limited English
proficiency customers and developing partnerships with other governmental
organizations such as the Department of Army Wounded Warrior Program (AW2).
Veterans Cemetery Grants Program (VCGP) personnel are working closely with VA’s
Office of Tribal Government Relations to support listening sessions at which information
about cemetery grants is shared. This outreach appears to be effective because VCGP
staff are receiving follow-up inquiries from attendees regarding the application process;
continuing its 5-year practice of adding family restrooms to the architectural designs of
new National cemeteries; convening a work group headed by the Acting Principal
Deputy Under Secretary to improve current and develop new processes and procedures
for Native American and Muslim internments at National Cemeteries; and approving
another Native American headstone emblem (Navajo), bringing the total Native
American headstone emblems to three. The Under Secretary and other executives at
NCA have served as guest speakers and participants at numerous Veteran-centric
events including:

e White House Asian American Pacific Islander Roundtable;

e Tribal Governments Consultation;

e Mobile Vet Center Rollout;

e VAMC Kansas City;

to review the site visit, discussions with the VAMC and RO staffs, and results of the
Town Hall meeting regarding the effectiveness of VA’s health care and benefits
services delivery to Veterans and families. The purpose of this session was to
discuss the issues and concerns raised by the Veterans and recommendations to
the VAMC and VA Regional Office, and National Cemetery Affairs staffs on
improving delivery of health care, benefits, and outreach services with regards to
minority Veterans.

o Develop metrics in measuring these equities

o Developing programs to develop cultural competency (referenced a program in
South Dakota-camping in rustic environments)

e Inthe forefront of importance, timely access to mental health programs, provide
good access to health care.

e Getting the appropriate level of productivity

e Patient Centered Care: Trying to create a healthcare delivery system: Patient
centered care-are the patients in control of their healthcare (need access to medical
records, well-vetted information on their healthcare.

e All services will be centered around the patient (Veteran): physical arrangement of
the healthcare facility, and the way the patient visits the healthcare system- the way
we are treating the whole patient.

e Need to personalize the patient.

e The briefings received during the 2012 ACMV site visit to the Lower Rio
Grande Valley reflects that VISN 17 has addressed the two ACMV 2003
Annual Report issues.

e On Oct 2010, TVCBHCS officially activated as an independent VA Health Care
System. Originally, TVCBHCS was a sub-facility of South Texas Veterans
Health Care System (STVHCS). A Senior Executive Service (SES) is authorized
to lead this Health Care System.

e VISN 17 has dramatically improved access to healthcare for Veterans in the
Lower Rio Grande Valley since the 2003 ACMV site visit.

e Local VHA management officials are aware that Veterans feel that they were
promised a standalone VA medical center, and still desire such a facility.

e Local VHA management officials are constantly adjusting local assets to provide
high quality care, and are conducting ongoing assessment including reviewing
the option of recommending the establishment of a standalone VA medical
center to meet local healthcare demands.

e Local Veterans are aware of the initiatives that were being put in place.

e However, they still feel that the best option to meet their healthcare needs is a
standalone VA medical center in the Lower Rio Grande Valley.

e The TVCBHCS is a “Super “CBOC’ with beyond Primary Care.

e TVCBHCS new facilities are constructed in accordance with Planetree principles
of a healing environment.

e The TVCBHCS has in-patient contracts for the Rio Grande Valley Sector with two
university health systems (Valley Baptist Health System and South Texas Health
System) to deliver care and also does fee-basis to contract for Non-VA care in
the local community.

e The TVCBHCS has meetings with VSOs to hear their concerns and also
conducts focus groups with Veterans to assess needs.

e The TVCBHCS implemented a “Blue Bag” concept that encouraged Veterans to
bring in all medications, whether prescribed through VA or Non-VA providers or
taken by the Veterans Over-the-Counter (OTC).

e The TVCBHCS uses a Rural Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) to deliver health care
services to communities in the lower Rio Grande Valley - the quality of care
delivered through the MMU was not identified.

e Forty-five employees have been hired to manage the fee-basis claims backlog
from non-VA providers.

e The TVCBHCS is now analyzing the transportation needs of Veterans in the
South Texas area to start a VA shuttle from Laredo.

e High turnover in providers at the TVCBHCS CBOCs. TVCBHCS is working with
the VISN 17 physician recruiter to address the physician vacancies.

e There is a need within the TVCBHCS to conduct targeted outreach to Veterans
including elderly, OEF/OIF, women, and in particularly to Native Americans.

e Fee for service doctors in the TVCBHCS catchment area are not being paid for
rendering services to Veterans in a timely manner. (Note: VISN 17 is setting up
and staffing within VISN a section to process fee-based claims)

e There are not enough doctors or nurses who can speak Spanish.

e VA need to increase outreach efforts to include younger Veterans, outreach by
the Houston Regional Office is non-existing.

e Claims backlog, it is taking at least two years or more to process claims.

e Veterans are not being informed when their claims are sent to other RO’s.

e Staff storage at all clinics and lack of specialty care, in particular the Podiatry and

e Long waits, Veterans are not being seen within the VA's standard twenty minutes
or less.

e CBOCs lack specialized mental health treatment and services.

e Elderly Veterans prefer to be communicated to in Spanish.

e Veterans over 60 may need additional training and information on how to access

e Quality issues at the Veterans Nursing Home run by the State of Texas — VA is
aware of the issues.

e Laredo Veterans do not want to belong to Coastal Bend Health Care System.
They prefer to fall under STVHCS. (Note: Director clarified that Laredo Veterans
could utilize the Audie Murphy VA Medical Center if they desired)

and her senior leadership was held on April 26, 2012 to review the site visit and discuss
the results of the VSO panel meeting regarding the effectiveness of VA’s health care
and benefits services delivery to Veterans and families.
ACMV Observations

e Challenges of recruiting providers to the area may continue due to the rural
infrastructure.

e The Veteran/provider relationship has been impacted by the current contracts
and fee-basis system, which VISN 17 is working to rectify.

e TVCBHCS has to refer higher level of care and surgical services including
neurology, cardiovascular, and spinal cord care/Polytrauma to San Antonio even
with a contractual relationship in place with two university health systems.

e The fee-basis process and transportation issues are being addressed.

e The provider turnover issue is not unique to this System as most rural areas have
trouble attracting and retaining providers.

e The ACMV recommended that cultural competency training and outreach needs
to be implemented in the System, particularly among senior-level staff so that
they understand the importance of listening, nonverbal communications, and
targeted outreach.

Statement was sent by Veteran and representative from the Filipino-American Veterans
and Families of America - Nevada was read during the public comment section:

Points Presented:

e Filipino World War II Veterans were denied compensation under the “American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009” - Filipino Veterans Equity
Compensation (FVEC) Fund because the National Personnel Records Center
(NPRC) could not verify if they served in the war with the Commonwealth Army
of the Philippines or United States forces.

e Stated he has seen some records that these individual have in their possession
that are not at the NPRC.

Departmental Response:
Individuals with Philippine service as a recognized member of one of the following may
be eligible for Veterans Affairs benefits:

e Regular Philippine Scouts

e Special Philippine Scouts

e Commonwealth Army of the Philippines inducted into the United States

Armed Forces, or

e United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) guerrillas.
The United States Armed Forces provided Philippine Scouts discharge certificates
similar to those issued to members of regular components of the United States Armed
Forces. In the absence of an original or certified copy of DD Form 214, verification of
service is obtained through NPRC.
Only original affidavits, other than those on standard government forms, are accepted
as evidence in support of Philippine claims. Evidence not accepted in support of
Philippine claims includes mimeographed, photocopied, or printed forms of affidavits,
other than those on stand government forms.
VA has paid 18,698 FVEC grants totaling $223,211,204 since February 17, 2009, when
the President signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment act of 2009, Public Law
111-5, Section 1002, authorizing payments to eligible Filipino Veterans. Eligible Filipino
Veterans were entitled to one-time payments of $9,000 for non-United States citizens
and $15,000 for Filipino Veterans with U.S. citizenship.

666,"Public Comment- April 24, 2012

Statement was sent by Veteran and member of American GI Forum. It was read during
the public comment section:

Points Presented:

e He felt that Veterans had an unreasonable burden of securing medical evidence
regarding military service illnesses or injuries, which happened decades ago. He
especially felt this was a burden for World War Il and Korean War Veterans.

¢ He stated that the delay in processing claims and the burden of providing
documentation caused many Veterans to drop their claims.

¢ Veterans need a full-service VA Hospital in The McAllen-Harlingen area. The
fact that the Veteran population with war returnees, will continue to grow requires
the establishment of a full service VA hospital in the area.

Departmental Response: VHA, VBA
The Department of Veterans Affairs has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining
evidence. Upon receipt of a substantially complete application for benefits, VA will
make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate
the claim. The claimant must cooperate fully with VA’s reasonable efforts to obtain
relevant records from Federal agency or department custodians. If requested by VA,
the claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records,
including the custodian or agency holding the records; the approximate time frame
covered by the records. If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of
existing records in form acceptable to the custodian or agency holding the records.
Obtaining records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency. VA will make
reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department
or agency, to include records from State or local governments, private medical care
providers, current or former employers, and other non-Federal governmental sources.
Such reasonable efforts will generally consist of an initial request for the records and, if
the records are not received, at least one follow-up request. A follow up request is not
required if a response to the initial request indicates that the records sought don not
exist or that a follow- up request for records would be futile. If VA receives information
showing that subsequent requests to this or another custodian could result in obtaining
the records sought, then reasonable efforts will include an initial request in obtaining the
records sought, then reasonable efforts will include an initial request and, if the records
are not received, at least one follow up request to the new source or an additional
request to the original source.
Obtaining records in custody of a Federal department of agency. VA will make as many
requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or

58
",0,0,0,0
667,"agency. These records include but are not limited to military records, including service
medical records; medical and other records from VA medical facilities; records from
non-VA facilities providing examination or treatment at VA expense; and records from
other Federal agencies, such as the Social Security Administration. VA will end its
efforts to obtain records from a Federal department or agency only if VA concludes that
the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be
futile. Cases in which VA may conclude that no further efforts are required include those
in which the Federal department or agency advises VA that the requested records do
not exist or the custodian does not have them.
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) commissioned a study, “VA Health Care Study
for Inpatient and Specialty Outpatient Services in the South Texas Valley Coastal Bend
Market,” to analyze the viability of a VA hospital in the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV)
to serve Veterans in a 20-county area from Laredo to Corpus Christi and areas south.
The study recommended the implementation of full service inpatient contracts and
emergency department services with local community hospitals in the LRGV.
In April 2009 VA contracted for emergency room and inpatient services for Veterans
with two high quality private hospital systems which provide Veterans with health care
services in Harlingen, Brownsville, Mc Allen and Edinburg. Since April 2009 the Rio
Grande Valley sector Veterans have had access to inpatient acute medical surgical
care, emergency care, and mental health inpatient care through inpatient contracts with
two local private sector hospital systems. Combined, these two community hospital
systems provide Rio Grand Valley Veterans with seven points of access to inpatient
care across the entire Valley market sector. This action has resulted in the highest level
of inpatient and emergency room access within the VA heart of Texas Health Care
Network.
VA leadership recognizes that the potential for growth of the Veteran population in this
market and requires a continual reassessment of our future expansion plan. VA will
continue to monitor closely the actual demand for VA services in the market to ensure
Veterans continue to have access to quality health care.

676,"* Follow Up Remarks by Center for Minority Veterans: 2011 ACMV Report - Recommendation 13
The Center for Minority Veterans (CMV) submitted a request to the VA Legislative Review Panel (LRP) to
have the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) Report changed from an annual to a biennial
report. The proposal was identified in this review cycle by a designation of: OOM-2, NEW, Requirement
for Biennial Report on Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. The Departmental LRP approved the
recommendation. Therefore, the proposal will be transmitted for consideration by the First Session of the
113"" Congress, so that the potential costs of approved legislative proposals can be incorporated into the
Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Congressional Budget Request for FY 2014. The potential outcome of
a favorable outcome of this request for a biennial report would result in the ACMV submitting its final
annual report in FY 13, no annual report being submitted in FY 14, and the first biennial report being
submitted in Fiscal Year 2015.
ACMV 2011 Report Action Plan- As of September 2011
Recommendations
A. Diversity
1. Establish hiring and retention strategies and increase recruitment of
minorities to improve minority representation within the Senior Executive
Service (SES) ranks by 2012, with a goal of attaining a significant increase in
minority representation within the ranks of the SES within the Department by
2015.
VA Response: Non-concur
2. Review the current diversity and inclusion training and update the training
modules, by the end of FY 2011, to include the topics of cultural competence and
emotional intelligence to ensure that they are relevant to address the Diversity
and Inclusion challenges that are present in the VA.

The Honorable Eric K. Shinseki
Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue, NW
Washington, DC 20420
Dear Secretary Shinseki:
| am deeply honored to be appointed as your Chair of the Advisory Committee for
Minority Veterans (ACMV) and giving our committee members the opportunity to assess
the needs of minority Veterans and their families. The 2013 annual report includes five ,
recommendations which are reflective of key issues identified by the committee through
briefings received at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office, our Chicago site visit, and
input from minority veterans at our town hall meeting.
With the changing demographics, our role on the Committee becomes vital in making
the VA a reflection of a more diverse Veteran population that it serves. Current VA
projections indicate that minority Veterans will be approximately thirty percent of the
overall Veteran population by 2030 (Source: Vet Pop). In addition, the FY 2010 Annual
Demographic Profile of the Department of Defense Active Duty and US Coast Guard
Profile reflected that approximately thirty six percent of the active forces were minorities,
and approximately forty-seven percent of active duty women were minorities. The high
unemployment rate among minorities (source: Department of Labor, Labor Force
Characteristic by Race and Ethnicity, 2011) emphasizes the importance of hiring
Veterans. The Committee was very impressed with the VA’s Veteran hiring initiatives.
However, we encourage the VA to review to the high rate of “regrettable loses” of
Veterans hired, and to also utilize industry proven best practices that promote retention.
The ACMV's 2013 report includes focuses on the unique needs of minority Veterans
and are in alignment with current VA initiatives. The Committee was pleased to see that
progress is being made on addressing several reoccurring recommendations from prior
annual reports. The three Administrations have incorporated action plans in their
responses to committee recommendations. The Department of Veterans Affairs is
making the necessary changes to be positioned to effectively manage present and
future challenges to support a more diverse stakeholder population, which includes
Veterans, their family members, and survivors. Based upon past recommendations, VA
has established the Office of Health Equity, developed a methodology to produce
appropriate minority Veterans data that will identify specific trends and patterns, and
explored the causes for the ongoing lack of diversity within its Senior Executive Service

mentai health professionals. The Committee anticipates that current initiatives involving
the new VA Office of Health Equity, and the anticipated publication of a Minority
Veterans Utilization Report, will also greatly enhance services provided to minority :
Veteran stakeholders.
We have recently reviewed the responses to our 2013 recommendations provided to
the Center for Minority Veterans. | draw your attention to the VBA response to
recommendation 5, which references the Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA) 2009
review on Veterans that separated between 1990 and 2009. The response does not
specifically indicate plans to initiate an updated demographic analysis. The actual

Title 38 United States Code (U.S.C.), Section 544, is the requirement for the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV)
to submit an annual report. The 2013 Annual Report of ACMV provides the
Committee’s observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the
effectiveness of VA's delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans. The report
also provides Departmental responses and action plans to address the 2013 ACMV
recommendations and a summary of the progress made on action plans from the
20itand 2012 ACMV reports.
ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in
accordance with Public Law 103-446, and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee
on Minority Veterans dated March 17, 2010. ACMV met on November 14-16, 2012, at
VA Central Office (VACO), and conducted a site visit in the Chicago metropolitan area
April 23-25, 2013. During the meeting, ACMV received briefings from Veterans Health :
Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), National Cemetery :
Administration (NCA), and select staff offices. Ex Officio members from the Department
of Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Defense (DoD), and Department
of Interior (DOL) provided briefings on their respective missions and services provided to
minority Veterans. During the Chicago site visit, the ACMV received briefings and
facility tours at the Hines VA Medical Center (VAMC), the Chicago VA Regional Office
(RO), the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, and the VA Joliet Community-Based
Outpatient Clinic. On the evening of April 24, 2013, ACMV and leadership from the
Hines VAMC, Jesse Brown VAMC, Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, and the
Chicago VARO responded to questions from minority Veterans and provided updates |
on current VA initiatives during a town hall meeting. ,
During this past year, ACMV reviewed information received during the meetings with VA
officials, conducted document reviews, and communicated directly with minority
Veterans. The Committee strongly believes that the five 2013 recommendations will
significantly enhance VA’s ability to strategically address the needs of minority
Veterans. These recommendations along with rationales address the following issues:
e Enhanced Targeted Outreach; |
e Succession Planning and Training Initiatives;
e Cultural Competency Training;
e Veteran Hiring and Retention; and
e Data Analysis and Benefits Utilization. |

Recommendation #1: That the VA establish a standard that requires Minority .
Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) in catchment areas that are comprised of |
large minority Veterans population of 30% or more, to perform a minimum of 20 hours of
targeted outreach in minority communities per month. MVPCs in catchment areas with
smaller minority Veterans populations of 25% or less are required to perform a minimum
of 10 hours of targeted outreach per month, as defined by VA MVPC Handbook 08074,
by the end of Fiscal Year 2074.
Recommendation #2: That the VA address the significant minority employee grade
disparity in the GS/GM 11-15 pay grades, Title 38 equivalent pay levels, and SES
: positions by the end of Fiscal Year 2014.
Recommendation #3: That the VA implement a cultural competency training program
for all mental health providers by the end of Fiscal Year 2015. .
Recommendation #4: That the VA Office of Human Resources and Administration
develop a methodology to determine the reasons/causes of removals/terminations
(regrettable losses) of recently hired minority Veterans by the end of Fiscal Year 2074.
Recommendation #5: That VA expedite the collection and analysis of demographic
data on minority Veterans to determine if disparities exists in the top five claimed
conditions, grant rate for disability claims, and percentages of disability granted, and
publish a report similar to the review that was recently completed on women Veterans |
by 2015. ,

Recommendation #1: That the VA establish a standard that requires Minority |

Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) in catchment areas that are comprised

of large minority Veterans population of 30% or more, to perform a minimum of 20

hours of targeted outreach in minority communities per month. MVPCs in .

catchment areas with smaller minority Veterans populations of 25% or less are :

required to perform a minimum of 10 hours of targeted outreach per month, as

defined by VA MVPC Handbook 0801 by the end of Fiscal Year 2014.

Rationale: The MVPCs in large catchment areas need adequate time to plan and

execute targeted outreach to fully address the needs of minority Veterans in their

catchment areas. In the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2013, MVPCs in areas of high

minority Veteran populations from the three VA Administrations conducted average

monthly hours of outreach as indicated: (VHA-8, VBA-6, NCA-3). During our recent visit |

to Edward Hines Jr. VAMC, it was noted that the MVPC conducted outreach programs.

However, her efforts were insufficient to cover the large number of minorities within the ,

catchment area. This was especially true for Veterans in outlying rural areas. In our

briefing with the Director of the Abraham Lincoin National Cemetery, he indicated that

the MVPC spent little time in this role because of the need to complete primary duties of

participation in burials. Additionally, MVPC Quarterly Reports reflect significant

inconsistencies in the amount of time dedicated to targeted outreach activities. The lack

of adequate time is also reflected in the quality of quarterly reports submitted.

According to VA Handbook 0801, the MVPC must maintain contact with the minority

communities, participate in conference calls about their activities, share experiences 7

with the group, keep minority Veterans informed about VA programs and services, and

keep the leadership informed about minority Veteran issues. The appointed MVPCs :

need the flexibility to do targeted outreach and additional time to perform these ,

collateral duties.

Action Office: VHA, VBA, NCA |

VA Response: Concur-in-Principle

VHA concurs in principle that a Minority Veterans Program Coordinator (MVPC) ina

catchment area comprised of a large minority Veterans population should perform .

targeted outreach; however, establishing a minimum number of hours to conduct

targeted outreach may not be necessary. MVPCs should have adequate time to plan ,

and conduct outreach activities. These outreach activities are designed to fully address :

the needs of minority Veterans. VHA fully supports VA Handbook 0801, which requires |

the VAMC Directors to provide MVPCs with sufficient time to perform their duties;

however, each VAMC’s catchment area may differ with respect to minority Veteran

population. The amount of time allocated to MVPC activities is affected by the

following: MVPC work-load, facility financial resources, and size of catchment area. A

specific requirement determining a minimum amount of time allocated to targeted |
9 ,
",0,0,0,0
707,"outreach could be burdensome. The VAMC Director and MVPC may not be able to
predetermine the number of hours to be allocated to targeted outreach each month due
to factors outside of their control. The VAMC Director and MVPC should be given the
flexibility to develop targeted outreach plans for minority Veterans, which could mean
more or less targeted outreach hours each month, depending upon the existing
conditions.
VAMC Directors and MVPC meet periodicaily to discuss operation plans, initiatives, and
the amount of time and resources necessary to address the needs of minority Veterans
in the catchment area. VHA leadership will closely monitor and strongly encourage
VAMC Directors to work with MVPCs, and when available, provide more resources for
the development of outreach strategies. VHA leadership will continue to make subject
matter experts (SME) available to VAMC Directors and MVPCs to provide meaningful
data in targeting minority Veterans. For example, VAMC Directors and MVPCs will 7
have access to VHA Office of Rural Health SMEs to assist in identifying minority
Veterans in rural and highly rural areas.
The MVPC Quarterly Report may not adequately describe and measure the number of
hours MVPCs are actually conducting outreach. Informal discussions with Veterans
Integrated Service Network (VISN) and VAMC staff suggest that inadequate record
keeping and administrative training in completing the operation plan are a contributing
factor to accurately recording outreach activities. We would encourage the Center for
Minority Veterans to provide additional training, not only to VAMC MVPCs, but to VISN
administrative staff who are involved in the VAMC concurrence process. Additional
training, we believe, will improve the quality of the operation plan submitted to VACO
and better reflect the numbers of hours MVPCs are actually conducting outreach.
NCA supports the concept to establish outreach goals for MVPCs based on the
demographics of the Veteran populations being served; however, NCA is not able to :
implement the specific minimum standards in the manner recommended by the |
Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV). NCA met with VA’s Center for
Minority Veterans to propose an alternative plan to establish outreach goals that are
tailored to each VA national cemetery. At VA cemeteries, the MVPC function is fulfilled
as a collateral duty. MVPC’s ability to accomplish program objectives is influenced by
the cemetery’s overail staffing size. Across NCA, cemetery staff ranges from one
employee to more than 60 employees. Therefore, NCA wiil assess the effect of monthly
outreach goals on cemetery staffing requirements and what goals should be established
based on each cemetery’s size, operational tempo, location, and demographics of the
Veterans communities being served. An important consideration in establishing
outreach goals will be each cemetery’s operational status — that is, whether each
cemetery is open or closed for first interments. NCA Central Office will assess these
factors in coordination with the Memorial Service Network offices to establish cemetery-
specific goals in the fiscal year (FY) 2014 Minority Veterans Program Coordinator -
Operations Plans. NCA’s goals and progress for MVPC outreach will be monitored and |
reported to the VA Center for Minority Veterans as part of the scheduled quarterly ,
reviews.
10
",0,0,0,0
708,"Concurrently, NCA has initiated several actions to help achieve the outreach goals

which will be established in the Minority Veterans Program Coordinator Operations

Plans. For example, NCA is developing a policy/practice that will require National

Cemetery MVPCs to send a minimum of 10 invitations to different minority organizations

in their local communities, inviting them to participate in cemetery programs and

ceremonies. These activities will include Veterans and Memorial Day ceremonies, as

well as dedications and other events held at national cemeteries throughout the couniry.

Target organizations for the invitations will include Veterans Service Organizations, civic

groups, local churches, and educational institutions. The Executive Diversity Council

(EDC) and the Special Emphasis Program Advisory Committee (SEPAC) at NCA are

having regularly scheduled meetings with committee members located Nationwide for

the purpose of increasing workforce cultural competency and diversity. These efforts

include linking EDC/SEPAC and regional MVPC activities as a method to intensify

Veterans outreach and program efficiency. NCA MVPCs will be required to establish |

contact with a minimum of one new minority servicing organization quarterly, and

collaborate with VHA/VBA counterparts to increase outreach opportunities.

Implementation of these strategies along with current MVPC operations will position the

administration to meet the goals that will be established and monitored quarterly with

VA's Center for Minority Veterans. |

Currently, the MVPCs in VBA’s 56 regional offices conduct targeted outreach to minority

Veteran populations within their catchment area through the use of census data and |

solicitation of national, local, and faith-based community organizations for outreach

opportunities. VBA has made significant efforts to increase outreach to minority

Veterans and continues to improve efforts by increasing the average number of

outreach hours dedicated to the minority Veteran population. Since FY 2010, VBA has

increased outreach hours by approximately 13 percent from 16 hours to 18 hours per

month. VBA currently averages 18 hours per month across the Nation, regardless of 7

the minority Veteran population size. VBA’s national monthly average is within 2 hours ,

of ACMV's recommended 20 hours per month. VBA does not believe it is necessary to -

establish a minimum standard but will continue to work to increase targeted outreach by :

MVPCs.

Recommendation #2: That the VA address the significant minority employee ,

grade disparity in the GS/GM 11-15 pay grades, Title 38 equivalent pay levels, and

SES positions by the end of Fiscal Year 2014.

Rationale: This objective and supporting plans to address grade disparity are depicted

in the VA FY 2012 Management Directive 715 Report (pages 47-49). The initial target

date for completion of the objective was 9/30/2012, but was shifted to 9/30/2013. As

recent as November 2012, the Committee was informed that grade disparity continued :

to be achallenge. One plan to conduct root cause analysis of the top 5 occupations to ,

determine barriers had a benchmark completion date of 9/30/2012 that was adjusted to |

9/30/15. 7
11 )
",0,0,0,0
709,"On January 24, 2013, the VA Acting Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, in his
National African American History Month memorandum, stated “African American/Black
men still have a lower than expected participation rate at the GS 11-15 levels and SES
pay levels, and African American/Black women have low participation rate at the GS 10,
12-15, and SES pay levels. VA will continue to market and encourage application of
employees who are African American/Black and from other groups with low participation
rates in career development and leadership programs. “
A recurring theme from previous ACMV reports 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 is that
there continues to be a lack of minorities in senior VA leadership levels, particularly the
Senior Executive Service (SES). Since Fiscal Year 2006 to June 2013, there has been
a net increase of 6 Hispanic males, 1 Hispanic female, 53 White males, 93 White
females, 12 Black females, 6 Asian males, 4 Asian females, and 2 American Indian/
Alaska Native females. During that same period, Black males remained at 16, Native
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander males and females remained at 0, and American
Indian/Alaska males decreased by 3. The VA June 2013 Diversity Report states:
“When looking at conventional SES positions, the representation of Hispanic females,
White males, Black males, Asian males and females, Native Hawaiian males and
females, and American Indian males continues to be below the government average.’
This trend continues with minimal improvemenis identified.
The ACMV noted that VA has robust strategic and diversity and inclusion plans
emphasizing minority-focused recruitment and development strategies, a best practices
recruitment and selection guide, and more recently, a Hispanic Employment, Retention
and Outreach Strategic Pian for FY 2013-2016. Further, VA has a Diversity Council,
recruitment programs such as VA for Vets and multi-level career and leadership
development programs for employee advancement through VA Learning University
(VALU) such as MyCareer@VA. Yet, in spite of these numerous plans and programs,
VBA, VHA, NCA, and VACO continue to be challenged in the senior levei
representation of minorities. This observation is supported with data published in the
VA Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) Annual Reports for 2009, 2010, and 2011 and the 5
Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan for FY 2012-2016, that shows marginal i:
improvement in the representation of minorities in senior leadership positions. :
Of particular concern, are the findings identified in ODI's February 2013 Hispanic
Permanent Workforce Review, which not oniy shows declining rates of Hispanic male
and female participation in the VA workforce, but also separation rates that are
increasing and exceeding hiring rates. This is surprising, given that the Hispanic
population grew by 43% from 2000-2010 and currenily represents over 16% of the
nation's population. lf this trend is not reversed through effective implementation of
VA's Hispanic Employment, Retention and Outreach Strategic Plan for 2013-2016;
recruiting and hiring Hispanics into VA senior ieadership levels will become a much
greater challenge. |

710,"VA Response: Concur
VA concurs with ACMV's recommendation that the objective to address grade disparity
is completed by the end of FY 2014. VA’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) -
performs reguiar analyses of VA’s workforce diversity by race, ethnicity, gender, and |
disability status. These analyses are reported to VA leadership on a quarterly basis,
and to the U.S. Equai Employment Opportunity Commission annually in VA’s
Management Directive (MD) 715 Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Plan and
Report. ,
MD 715 provides policy guidance and standards for establishing and maintaining
effective affirmative programs of equal employment opportunity under Section 717 of
Title VI (PART A), and effective affirmative action programs under Section 501 of the
Rehabilitation Act (PART B). The Directive aiso sets forth general reporting
requirements (PART C). The VA 2012 MD 715 Report reflects an agency-wide (VHA, ,
VBA, NCA, Staff Offices) system for the evaluation of program effectiveness and barrier
identification and elimination. The purpose of the report is to document that the agency ,
has adequate data systems for effective analyses of applicant flow, on-board workforce,
and personnel transactions data; and providing current guidance for the development of ,
program plans to all component and field installations.
ODI identified grade disparity as a “trigger” that may suggest potential barriers to EEO |
in VA. Specifically, “In the GS/GM 11-15 and Title 38 equivalent pay levels, every
group except White men have some disparity when compared to the distribution of the
total VA permanent workforce participation rate in those grades.” “In addition, certain
groups (Biack, Pacific Islander, American Indian, and Hispanic men) have a higher than
average participation rate in Wage Grade occupations compared to the total workforce.”
The grade disparity trigger further identified two potential barriers that warranted
address: These barriers were:
e There is not a focused outreach and recruitment pian that targets these groups
for employment consideration at the higher pay grade, or no strategy for
supporting these employees in qualifying for positions with promotion potential.
e There is a lack of applicant flow data to identify other potential barriers to upward
mobility.
To address these barriers, ODI established a goal in the VA Diversity and inclusion
Strategic Plan for FY 2012-2016 to “Build a diverse and high performing workforce that
reflects all segments of society.” (Goal 1 of VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Pian.) ,
To attain this goai, VA established the following objective with 12 on-going supporting :
planned activities (VA 2012 MD 715 Report, pages 48-51): |
Objective - “Perform additional analysis to identify other barriers, and also develop ,
Career Pathways project and other training/developmental strategies to facilitate ,
13
",0,0,0,0
711,"upward mobility for employees at lower/dead-end careers. Conduct strategic targeted |
recruitment outreach for positions in the higher pay grades.”
To date, the following milestones have been accomplished toward meeting that i:
objective: |
e VA implemented the VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Pian aimed at
eradicating barriers to EEO and diversity through the pursuit of 3 overarching
goals, 8 aligned objectives, and 45 implementing strategies and performance
metrics. ODI monitors VA’s progress against this Plan on a quarterly basis.
e ODI developed and implemented the Hispanic Employment, Retention, and
Outreach (HERO) Plan to address persistent underrepresentation of Hispanics in
the VA workforce and in select occupational categories and grade levels. The
Plan includes strategic targeted outreach to the Hispanic Veteran and student
community, to achieve diversity in multiple dimensions. The HERO Plan is
directly aligned with the VA Diversity and Inclusion Strategic goals, and is
monitored by ODI on a regular basis. :
e ODI implemented an applicant flow system for Senior Executive Service
recruitment and development processes to identify barriers and adverse impact
to diverse groups. Additionally, ODI is partnering with the Office of Personnel
Management to implement a VA-wide applicant flow system to identify barriers to
EEO in all VA recruitment processes. To date, VA is leading this effort
Governmentwide.
e ODI launched a MyCareer@VA pilot project in partnership with VA Learning
University to address grade disparities of diverse groups of employees,
especially at the GS-9 and below levels and on Wage Grade occupations. The
pilot was launched and completed at two VA Medical Centers (Martinsburg, West
Virginia, and Washington, DC) and yielded very favorable results by program
participants on the value of the Career Power mapping tool. ODI plans to
perform follow-up surveys with pilot participants to ascertain the impact of the
pilot on participants’ career/grade progression. Based on the results, ODI will
expand the pilot program to other facilities.
Recommendation #3: That the VA implement a cultural competency training
program for all mental health providers by the end of Fiscal Year 2015.
Rationale: During the November 2012 briefing in Washington, DC, the Office of
Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) reported that cultural competency training is not
mandatory for these newly hired professionals. Research shows that minority Veterans
experience difficulties in receiving mental health services due to ineffective provider
communication (insensitivity, mistrust and poor listening)’ and cultural belief systems
discouraging the use of mental health services. Minority cultures often do not look
favorably on acknowledging mental illness or seeking help and treatment for mental
health—a behavior that may be exacerbated by the warrior mentality of military service.
In fact, the stigma of mental illness among some ethnic/racial minority groups may
discourage people from seeking mentai health care, medication and counseling.’ |
14
",0,0,0,0
712,"Therefore, illnesses like depression and PTSD may be left untreated which is

problematic given that being an ethnic minority in the military may increase stress and )

stress reactions outside of combat exposure.’ In some cases, minority patients may rely

on extended family, community, traditional healers and/or churches for help with mental ;

health needs.: 7

To provide culturally competent care, mental health professionals should be aware of .

minority patient belief systems regarding mental health, and alternative treatments to ,

ensure minority and rural Veterans receive diagnosis and culturally relevant treatment

that result in positive outcomes. This cultural competence may need to inciude

linguistically appropriate responses fo incorporate the minority Veteran's family into the

treatment modaiity.

VA Response: Concur-in-Principle

VHA agrees that mentai health providers should have cultural competency training. ,

VHA mental health providers generally receive cultural competency training as a

requirement of their accredited graduate education programs in mental health

disciplines. As such, additional cultural competence training as a mandatory

requirement by the end of FY 2015 for VHA mental health providers is not necessary.

Recommendation #4: That the VA Office of Human Resources and

Administration develop a methodology to determine the reasons/causes of

removals/terminations (regrettable losses) of recently hired Veterans by the end

of Fiscal Year 2014.

Rationale: According to the Fiscal Year 2012 Veterans Hire Demographics

Separations report, there were a total of 6,747 removals, resignations and terminations ,

from VA employment. In the briefings presented, the reason for this high number was

unknown. Therefore, VA needs to identify why 40% of newly hired Veterans leave VA

employment within 12 months of being hired. Although the latest unemployment rates :

for Veterans are improving, minority Veterans continue to lag behind in terms of

employment. Therefore, it becomes important for VA to focus on its retention of

Veterans.

A review of several studies which addressed employee retention indicated that

recruiting and hiring a new employee could range from 50-150% of the annual salary of

a retained employee.** Therefore, retention is crucial in containing recruitment costs,

while significantly contributing to lowering unemployment rates of deserving Veterans.

Further reported research for companies that used exit interviews or questionnaires with

departing employees revealed the following information: the primary reasons for

leaving were poor relationships and/or communications with one's supervisor, poor

quality of co-worker or customer relationships, need for more work/life balance and low

levels of employee engagement.’ ,

Recommendation #5: That VA expedite the collection and analysis of
demographic data on minority Veterans to determine if disparities exists in the top
five claimed conditions, grant rate for disability claims, and percentages of
disability granted, and publish a report similar to the review that was recently ,
completed on women Veterans by 2015. .
Rationale: The availability and utilization of race/ethnic data will assist the VA to

respond to the requirements of 38 U.S.C. section 544(c), which requires the ACMV to

make “such recommendations (including recommendations for administrative and

legislative action) as the Committee considers appropriate, and 38 U.S.C. section

317(d)(5), which will assist the Center for Minority Veterans to “conduct and sponsor ,
appropriate research on the needs of Veterans who are minorities and to the extent to

which programs authorized under this title meet the needs of those Veterans, without

regard to any law concerning the collection of information from the public’. Until

recently representative race/ethnicity data was not available. VA has developed

methodology to collect demographic data which should provide an opportunity to

conduct preliminary reviews.

In town hall meetings in Chicago, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; and Fayetteville, North

Carolina; minority Veterans have expressed the opinion that they feel that the

percentage levels that they receive for disability, especially PTSD claims are

significantly lower than that received by non-minority Veterans. VA officials during

these town hall sessions have been able io describe the process of assessing disability

levels, but have not been able to present actual data that would dispel this belief of |
potential disparities. The publication of a VA report would prove valuable in dispelling

long standing perceptions of minority Veterans regarding the disability rating process.

16
",0,0,0,0
714,"VA Response: Concur-in-Principle
VBA concurs-in-principle with the recommendation regarding the importance of .
analyzing factors that could coniribute to differences in disability compensation
awards. In 2009, VBA contracted with the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) to
study such differences, including differences among minority Veterans. IDA’s report
demonstrates the complexity of conducting such an analysis.
IDA pointed out that differences in average compensation do not necessarily imply
unequal treatment of Veterans, and that answering the question of disparities or
unequal treatment requires first examination of the factors that lead to a
compensation award, and then determination of which of these factors are explained
by characteristics of the Veterans and their applications rather than by VBA
judgments and decisions. VBA believes that any demographic analysis conducted in
the future should again be conducted by an expert analytical organization such as |
IDA.
The Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) may be able to assist VBA in an empirical
analysis to determine if there is any evidence to support the perception of racial
disparity in disability claims. OPP is currently reviewing race and ethnicity information
available to the Department in an effort to determine its suitability for use in analysis. If
OPP determines that it has reasonable data on race and ethnicity, staff can link it with
VBA claims and award information to examine the perception of racial disparity.

and comments. Locai VA representatives answered numerous questions related to the
claims process, employment opportunities, and various VA benefits and services.
Veterans aiso made personal requests for assistance. Veterans asked the Committee
to inform VA leadership that they were interested in the expansion of dental services.
They also expressed that many Veterans perceived that minorities were awarded
disability compensation levels at lower rates than non-minority Veterans. The Town
Hall confirmed a need for ongoing targeted outreach activities to inform Veterans and

Chicago VARO, and Abraham National Cemetery, April 25, 2013.

Exit Briefing Observations .

Observations related to the Hines VAMC:

e The Committee noted that the VAMC had numerous programs in place to meet
the clinical needs of Veterans from diverse periods of service and medical needs.

e The Hines VAMC appeared to be well maintained.

e All facility staff members demonstrated a commitment to provide excellent
service to Veterans. . ,

, e The Hines VAMC and the Joliet CBOC were in areas readily accessible by public
transportation.

e The Committee members identified opportunities for the MVPC to initiate
outreach to several Native American Veteran groups in the catchment area.

e The Committee members encouraged the use of race/ethnicity data being
incorporated in the reviews of participants in leadership training programs and
recruitment actions to promote diversity in leadership positions at the medical
center.

Observations related to the Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery:

e The Abraham Lincoln Cemetery is a very beautiful and well maintained facility.

e Its remote location poses a challenge to encourage Veterans and family .
members from the central city area and Chicago suburbs east of the city to a

, access burial services. .

e The Committee noted that only one minority candidate was interviewed for a staff
position at the cemetery in over 10 years. This appears to be attributed to the
remote location of the facility, but also highlights a need for programs to enhance
recruitment of minorities and women to apply for positions at remote VA facilities.

e The cemetery leadership was asked to consider coordinating MVPC outreach |
activities on days that traditionally had fewer burials, and to collaborate as much :
as possible with the Hines VAMC and the Chicago VARO to provide buriai |
benefits information io area Veterans.

721,"Observations related to the Chicago VARO
e The facility is modern, well maintained, and utilizes state of the art security |
measures.
e The facility is located in close proximity to the Jessie Brown VAMC and public
transportation. This promotes the use of the facility by local Veterans, especially
those that use the facility in conjunction with scheduled appointments at the
VAMC.
e During the town hall meeting, the VARO Director was able to explain the claims
process, inform Veterans what was being done to address the claims backlog,
and explained the benefits of submitting a fully developed claim and the use of
| eBenefits. Veterans at the town hall meeting appeared receptive to the
information that was provided. |
Note: Targeted outreach by the MVPC and other VA outreach staff is needed by
minority Veterans in the Chicago area to help them address clinical, financial, and
education challenges. 7

Recommendation #8: VA officials from the three Administrations should ensure :
that Veteran’s demographic data made available from local VA Minority Veterans |
Program Coordinators (MVPCs) is utilized by local individuals conducting ,
outreach to conduct targeted outreach to all identified ethnic Veteran populations -
in their catchment areas. 7
VA Response: Concur
As a standard procedure since FY 2007, the National Cemetery Administration (NCA)
has utilized tne full spectrum of Veterans’ demographical data available from the both
the Census Bureau and VA’s own data systems as a primary method to increase .
contact with minority Veterans. Since FY 2007, NCA’s Equal Employment Opportunity ,
(EEO) Office has sponsored training on how to best extract demographical data from ,
the VHA Service Support Center (VSSC). All NCA Cemetery Directors, MVPCs, MSN |
Directors, and Human Resources (HR) Liaisons are trained where the information is ,
located and how to retrieve it and are reminded to make full utilization of the data at |
every opportunity. Ms. Juanita Mullen, who is the American Indian Veterans Liaison at ;
CMV, attends ail NCA MVPC quarterly meetings to provide insight and best practices
for implementing outreach and recruitment strategies for American Indian communities.
NCA continues to participate in events specifically targeting Native American and Asian
American/Pacific Islander Veterans nationwide; during outreach events, participants are ,
informed of the services and benefits provided to Veterans and their families by NCA.
Some of the outreach events in the Texas area that NCA has participated in this fiscal
year include: Heroes and Heritage Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012; Fort Sam
Houston, San Antonio, Texas; League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)
National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012; Hilton Houston Oak, Houston, Texas; ,
and the Gathering of Nations Pow Wow, April 27-28, 2012. In addition, NCA has
participated in other events targeting these communities including Indian Traders

recruitment efforts with a goal of hiring staff that are diverse and reflective of the

Veteran population.

VA Responses: Concur |

As a part of the MVPCs normal outreach duties, they provide Veterans a copy of NCA’s

brochure with information on how to apply for employment opportunities at NCA. In :

FY 2012, NCA offices nationwide have participated in several outreach events

specifically targeting Native American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander

Veterans. As a practice, NCA utilizes these opportunities for recruitment to further

diversify the workforce as well as increasing minority participation in the services and

benefits that we provide. Some of the measures NCA has taken to improve Native

American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans’ participation so far in

FY 2012 include the Under Secretary, Mr. Muro, as well as other NCA executives

serving as guest speakers at events focusing on outreach and recruitment of these |

targeted groups, including the White House Asian American Pacific Islander

Roundtable, and the Tribal Governments Consultation in Washington, DC.

In addition, NCA has participated in outreach at events in Texas such as the Heroes |

and Heritage Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio,

Texas, and the LULAC National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012, Hilton

Houston Oak, Houston, Texas. Through NDIP, NCA provides opportunities for students

from the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), the Asian Pacific American

Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS), and the Internationa! Leadership

Foundation (ILF) to gain Federal job experience for ten weeks. This program serves as

a very useful long range recruiting tool. In FY 2012, several of the NDIP interns were

obtained through Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) outreach. |

NCA has established partnerships with the ILF, APAICS, and OCA to sponsor students

throughout the year at various cemetery locations nationwide. .

The Veterans Cemetery Grants Program conducts quarterly conference cails and e- :

mails program updates to state cemeteries and other organizations about pending :

grants. Individual conference calls have been conducted with Hawaii and Guam

providing guidance on their pending project; this initiative ensures funding and ,

additional employment opportunities for Asian American/Pacific islander communities.

In FY 2012, two Tribal grants have been approved and another is pending.

Recommendation #7: Develop an action plan to increase access to VA programs :
and services (VHA/VBA/NCA), and facilities for Veterans living in rural and 7
outlying territories (insular areas) by 2nd Quarter FY 2012. |
Rationale: During the Advisory Committee meeting, a member of the committee who |
resides on Guam provided an update on the needs and challenges for insular areas as |
follows: ,
33
",0,0,0,0
731,"1) Guam |
Veterans face numerous challenges in accessing health care: .
e There is no iocally based Wounded Warrior or Residential Post-traumatic ,
Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (BTI) treatment program. ,
e Returning Veterans with chronic PTSD, TBI had to wait receiving service ,
connection category of at least 30% for the VA to cover transportation to
e Hawaii, and this process takes up to six months.
e There are no providers for Agent Orange and other Specialty Exams.
e There is no Home-Based Primary Care Program.
e There is no Skilled Nursing Facility and Long-Term Care Community Living
Center.
e The recenily constructed Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) is too
smali to accommodate the number of Veterans seeking care.
To address these issues, VHA needs io allocate adequate resources and hire skilled
and qualified personnel. Collaborating with DoD to use space for Veterans within the
new Naval Hospital to be built on Guam may be one integrated solution.
Space available in Veteran cemeteries is rapidly dwindling: ,
e The cemetery will be completely fitled by 2012. |
e No additional in-ground burials unless the coffin is oversized or it is a married
couple.
To address this issue, NCA needs funding to perform environmental and geological
testing on a new site immediately.
Homeless Veterans: “Migrant” Veterans from off-island and on-island (homeless
Veterans and family going from family to family and staying with them) are
increasing in numbers.
It soon may be necessary to increase the number of vouchers for homeless Veterans to
accommodate the needs and use space from the soon to be built Naval Hospital.
2) Saipan
Veterans face numerous challenges in accessing health care and benefits:
e VA has rented a space for the Rural Outreach Clinic, but the facility has
e Neither personne! nor equipment (furniture, computers, etc.) in it.
e Veterans often must pay out-of-pocket to be seen on Guam for their service- |
connected aliments. Itineraries are mailed but do not reach them on time. !
e VA toll-free numbers do not work with the exception of 800-827-1000, so
e Veterans cannot conveniently call for questions regarding health, GI Bill, or
Memorial Services.

Recommendation #13: Propose legislation that will change the requirement for
an annual report from the ACMV to a biennial report. :
Rationale: Currently Public Law 103-446 requires the ACMV to submit an annual
report to the Department by July 1* of each year, and that report with the Department's
responses to the ACMV recommendations is due to Congress on September 1° of each
year. The ACMV conducts its annual Washington, DC meeting normally within the first
quarter of the fiscal year, and its site visit in the third quarter of the fiscal year.
Therefore, the current timeframe precludes ample time for the Department to develop
initiatives in response to the recommendations that can be reported during the ACMV’s |
annual meeting in Washington, DC and be made part of the minutes reflected in the |
annual report. A biennial timeframe would allow the Department more time to develop,
measure, and document Initiatives that have been taken in response to the ACMV
recommendations.

The Honorable Robert A. McDonald
Secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20420
Dear Secretary McDonald:
| am deeply honored to serve as your Chair of the Advisory Committee for
Minority Veterans (ACMV). The enclosed 2014 Annual Report includes six
recommendations which reflect key challenges identified by the committee
through briefings received at the VA Central Office; a site visit to New York City-
area VA facilities; and feedback from a minority veterans’ town hall meeting.
The ACMV's 2014 report includes challenges on the unique needs of minority
veterans which provide a great opportunity for improvement of the delivery of
benefits and services to minority veterans and their families. We want to share a
summary of our findings for improvement of care and services to our minority
veterans.

Access - You will note in our 2014 report that many of the locations of our
past Committee site visits had the highest wait times in their Veterans Integrated
Service Networks (VISNs). This was especially true for veterans in the insular
areas and other highly rural areas. Minority veterans in these locations
experience challenges accessing VA health care and disability claims assistance.
The lack of sufficiently trained veterans service representative and accredited VA
outreach resources constrains a veteran's ability to access a knowledge-base to
effectively and efficiently initiate and process a disability claim. Thereby
unnecessarily exacerbating the already backlogged disability claim appeal
process. This is further complicated by an eBenefits system which veterans and
their advocates can neither understand nor manipulate. We encourage you to
consider the possibility of expanding call center capabilities to provide especially
older veterans a live person to address questions on benefits issues.

Cultural Competency - A more diverse veterans’ patient population highlights
the need to have VA providers, especially in psychiatric care, culturally
competent.

Health Disparities — With the recent establishment of VHA Office of Health
Equity (OHE), the Department is encouraged to provide this new office funding
above personnel costs to support projects that align with achieving OHE mission
and goals.

4 ,
",1,0,0,0
746,"Diversity - We encourage the Department to utilize the opportunity to recruit
minorities to senior leadership positions and to promote that diversity in
Department leadership in the 21“ Century.

The ACMV respectfully requests that responses from VHA, VBA, NCA, and VA
proponent staff include specific data and recommendations at the next ACMV
conference which is tentatively scheduled on October, 2014 in Washington, DC.
| extend the Committee's special thanks to the staff of the Center for Minority
Veterans for their continued outstanding support of the ACMV. We appreciate the
Department's confidence and trust in ACMV’s efforts to provide
recommendations in the 2014 Annual Report which may only serve to enhance
the opportunity of the Department to address the needs of minority veterans.
ln summary, the members of the ACMV are grateful for the opportunity to serve
the VA as well as our nation’s minority veterans and their families. We look
forward to continuing that service while strengthening programs and values of the
VA under your leadership.

We are very proud to serve ail of our veterans of this institution with strong
values.
Sincerely,
, Oscar Hilman

747,"Part l. Executive Summary
The 2014 Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the
Committee’s observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the
effectiveness of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) delivery of benefits and
services to minority Veterans. The report also provides Departmental responses and
action plans to address the 2014 ACMV recommendations, and a summary of the
progress made on action plans from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 ACMV reports.
The ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in
accordance with Public Law 103-446, and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee
on Minority Veterans dated March 27, 2014. The ACMV met on December 9-11, 2013,
at VA Central Office (VACO), and conducted a site visit in the New York City,
metropolitan area from April 29 - May 1, 2014. During the meeting at VACO, the ACMV
received briefings from Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and select staff offices.
Ex Officio members from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Interior (DOI) provided briefings on
their respective missions and services provided to minority Veterans during the VACO
meeting. During the New York City site visit, the ACMV received briefings and facility
tours at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (Peters VAMC), the New York VA
Regional Office (VARO), the Long Island and Calverton National Cemeteries, and the
Yonkers Community Clinic. During the afternoon of April 30, 2014, the ACMV and
representatives from the Peters VAMC, Long Island National Cemetery, and New York
VARO responded to questions from minority Veterans and provided updates on current
VA initiatives during a town hall meeting.
During this past year, the ACMV reviewed information received during our meetings
with VA officials, conducted document reviews, and communicated directly with minority
Veterans. The Committee strongly believes that the six 2014 recommendations will
significantly enhance VA’s ability to strategically address the needs of minority
Veterans. These recommendations and rationales address the following issues:
e Enhancing Targeted Outreach by Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPC).
e Conducting cultural competency training for mental health providers (re-submission).
e Updating the VA Schedule for Rating Disabilities to recognize the unique medical
conditions that impact minority Veterans.
e Displaying the flags of the District of Columbia and Insular Areas at National
Cemeteries. ,
e Providing the VHA Office of Health Equity (OHE) funding above personnel costs to
support projects that align with achieving OHE mission and goals.

749,"Part Il. Summary of 2014 Recommendations

Recommendation #1: That the VA establish a standard that requires the Minority

Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) Program in catchment areas that are

geographically-extended over 200 miles, to assign the appropriate percentage of duties

to an employee(s) in VHA and VBA facilities outside of the respective host VA Regional

Office (VARO) and VA Medical Center (VAMC) locations.

Recommendation #2: That the VA implement a cultural competency training program

for all mental health providers and Veterans Service Representatives by the end of

Fiscal year 2015. ,

Recommendation #3: That the VA update the Schedule for Rating Disabilities (Part 4,

Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations) to accommodate medical research on

symptomatology of certain medical conditions which have particular application to

minority Veterans of differing cultures.

Recommendation #4: That the VA direct all VA National Cemeteries to prominently

display the District of Columbia and insular flags of all United States territories as they

do flags from the 50 states.

Recommendation #5: Recommend that VHA provide the Office of Health Equity

(OHE) with a budget that allocates adequate funding to support projects that align with

achieving OHE mission and goals.

Recommendation: #6: Recommend that the Veterans Heaith Administration conduct

an assessment of the impact that prolonged clinic wait times have had on access to

care by minority Veterans at selected facilities with large minority Veteran populations.

750,"Part Hl. ACMV 2014 Recommendations, Rationales, and VA Responses
Recommendation #1: That the VA establish a standard that requires the Minority
Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs) Program in catchment areas that are
geographically-extended over 200 miles, to assign the appropriate percentage of
duties to an employee(s) in VHA and VBA facilities outside of the respective host
VA Regional Office (VARO) and VA Medical Center (VAMC) locations.
Rationale: Having noted the time and distance challenges for MVPCs to meet
outreach demands in the Hines VAMC catchment area, the Advisory Committee on
Minority Veterans (ACMV) included in their 2013 Annual Report a recommendation that
the VA establish a standard that requires MVPCs in catchment areas of different
population sizes to dedicate a certain percentage of duty hours to targeted outreach.
While it is not apparent that the VA has yet established such national standards, the
2014 ACMV site visit to the Peters VAMC indicates the individual VAMCs, with the
appropriate leadership priorities, have locally established such standards.
VA Handbook 0801 dictates that MVPCs must maintain contact with minority
communities. Despite establishing local targeted outreach standards, and given
continuing VA budget constraints on travel and per diem, MVPCs with geographically-
extended catchment areas (as in New York State) cannot adequately provide targeted
outreach to distant locations in those catchment areas.
The ACMV Subcommittee on VA Benefits review of annualized 2013 MVPCs results
and projected 2014 MVPCs results for two quarters indicates a decrease in MVPCs
activities and average hours of MVPC outreach per month despite oral feedback from
individual minority Veterans and widespread perception from the minority Veterans
community at-large there is an increased demand for such services regardless of the
catchment area size or geographic extension. For example, in 2013 there were a
reported number of 4,094 activities nationally in the VBA. For the first two quarters of
2014, there were only 1,494 ‘activities’ nationally in the VBA; extrapolated over the
duration of 2014, that would result in approximately 2,928 activities nationally in the
VBA or a 28% decrease in MVPC ‘activities’ in the VBA from 2013 to 2014 which is not
the correct direction for inclusiveness through MVPC outreach that the VA should seek
to achieve.

~The ACMV Subcommittee on VA Benefits review of MVPCs results for 2013 and 2014
showed that the average number of MVPCs outreach hours per month in the VBA in
2013 was 19 hours. Using a conservative formula .of twenty-two business days of eight
hours per day equates to 196 monthly MVPCs hours dedicated to MVPC outreach
which is less than 10% of MVPC business time dedicated to minority Veterans’ outreach
when the demand for such outreach appears to be much greater. In 2014, the percent
of MVPC outreach hours has to date, decreased to 8.6%. The 2014 Quarterly MVPCs
Reports consistently document insufficient MVPCs time and funding for effective
minority Veterans outreach.

751,"The assignment of a percentage of duty time for targeted outreach to VA employees in

outlying VA facilities (like a VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic in up-state New

York) may better able supplement the already demanding assigned MVPCs who have

limited travel and per diem budgets and still meet the intent of the goals for targeted

outreach in VA Handbook 0801.

VA Responses:

NCA Response: Concur

On July 17, 2014, NCA Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office conducted an

outreach communications plan meeting. Attending parties included the NCA MVPC

Liaison, the NCA EEO Director, the NCA Outreach Coordinator, and a representative

from the Center for Minority Veterans. Items discussed during the meeting included:

providing NCA MVPCs with a listing of other MVPCs in their catchment areas as a

method to increase outreach opportunities to Minority Veterans and to improve the

efficient usage of Departmental outreach resources, and providing NCA MVPCs with

quarterly outreach opportunities listings to increase the level of outreach to minority

Veterans. Other discussion points included having MVPCs from the different

Administrations form outreach teams to develop outreach strategies and share

materials to disseminate at outreach events. Finally, MVPCs will be required to include

collaboration with VHA and VBA counterparts on the operations plans included with

MVPC Quarterly Reports.

752,"VBA Response: Non Concur
VBA's MVPCs conduct outreach to targeted minority populations as part of their
collateral duties. VBA does not have full-time MVPCs or out-based MVPCs and could
not feasibly perform an established percentage of outreach in catchment areas that are
geographically extended over 200 miles. In FY 2013, VBA conducted 4,094 minority
events/activities within 2,768 hours to 87,620 minority Veterans. This data reflects
VBA's total outreach to minority Veterans, since it includes outreach performed by
employees other than MVPCs. During the first seven months of FY 2014, VBA
conducted more limited outreach, which is partially attributed to the Federal government
shutdown and subsequent furlough of VBA employees from
October 7-17, 2013, and the “Spring Surge” in April 2014, where VBA employees
placed special emphasis on disability claims processing to support meeting the Agency
Priority Goal of reducing the claims backlog. The third quarter of the fiscal year is
normally VBA’s busiest outreach quarter, since it includes supporting the conventions of
major Veterans Service Organizations with minority Veteran populations. VBA’s
outreach efforts cannot be fully assessed by only viewing the first two quarters of data.
VHA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA concurs-in-principle with the Committee’s recommendation. MVPCs in catchment
areas that are geographically-extended have unique challenges in conducting outreach
because of the size of the catchment area. VHA fully supports VA Handbook 0801,
which requires a VAMC Director to provide MVPCs with sufficient time to perform their
duties, including outreach; however, the position of MVPC generally is a collateral duty,
and VAMC Directors must ensure that MVPCs fulfill their primary duties and
responsibilities. Nonetheless, VAMC Directors strive to provide adequate time for
MVPCs to conduct meaningful outreach to minority Veterans.
Currently, VAMC Directors do not assign a specific percentage of an MVPC’s duties to
conduct outreach. In addition to outreach, MVPC duties may include attending
meetings, attending town halls, distributing printed materials, providing health care
benefits counseling, and providing guidance to a VAMC Director regarding marketing to
minority Veterans. Thus, VAMC Directors require flexibility to determine the amount of
time and resources MVPCs require to conduct outreach to maintain a balance of duties
and responsibilities of the MVPC.
VAMC Directors and MVPCs meet periodically to discuss outreach duties, how outreach
will be conducted, and the resources needed to conduct the outreach. Dictating a
percentage of time that must be devoted to outreach efforts could interfere with the
VAMC Director's responsibility to manage staffing needs and ensure the safety and
effective operation of his or her facility in providing quality health care to Veterans.
VAMC Directors will continue to closely monitor MVPC outreach results and, when
possible, make needed adjustments to increase outreach activities, especially in large
catchment areas.

753,"Recommendation #2: That the VA implement a cultural competency training
program for all mental health providers and Veterans service representatives by
the end of Fiscal year 2015.

Rationale: The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans made a similar

recommendation in 2013 for mandatory cultural competency for mental health

professionals. Veterans Health Administration’s response was: “Concur-in-Principle- |

VHA mental health providers generally receive cultural competency training as a

requirement of their accredited graduate education programs in metal health disciplines.

As such, additional cultural competence training as a mandatory requirement by the end

of FY 2015 for the VHA mental health providers is not necessary.”

As mandatory cultural competency training has not yet been established for mental

health providers; as mental health providers treatment records are an integral part of

many Veterans benefits and services (to include service-connection for disabilities); as
cultural competency training for mental health providers which ts unique to the medical
conditions of minority Veterans is not included in training modules of VA mental health
providers graduate school training; and as the need for such a program was validated

during the ACMV 2014 on-site visit to the Peters VA Medical Center, the Advisory

Committee on Minority Veterans respectfully submits its current 2014 recommendation

for reconsideration for the following reasons.

e As codified by the Office of Minority Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, research is replete with documentation which shows that minority Veterans
often choose not to access VA mental health services or may become a ‘no-show’
for a mental health appointment or may ‘drop-out’ of an on-going therapy treatment
protocol due to ineffective provider communication (insensitivity, mistrust, cultural
misunderstanding).

e Scholarly research conducted or reviewed by such organizations as the Office of
Rural Health, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Institute on Diversity in
Health Management have consistently shown the value of cultural competency
training, especially for mental health providers serving the minority population. Such
training would prove to enhance communications as well as the processing of
benefits and services for minority Veterans which are often inextricably connected to
mental health conditions in Veterans. The establishment of mandatory cultural
competency training for mental health providers may similarly prove to enhance
medical treatment plans for minority Veterans as well as to improve access and
retention rates for mental health benefits and services for minority Veterans.

e Cultural competence programs have proliferated in U.S. medical schools in
response to increasing national diversity, as well as mandates from accrediting
bodies. Although such training programs share common goals of improving
physician-patient communication and reducing health disparities, they often differ in |
their content, emphasis, setting, and duration. Moreover, training in cross-cultural
medicine may be absent from students’ clinical rotations, when it might be most

12

754,"relevant and memorable’. (A prescription for Cultural Competence in Medical

Education- abstract-introduction). This incongruity may be exacerbated by the

absence of veteran-specific cultural competency programs in U.S. medical schools.

e The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) recently published an article entitled

Barriers to Mental Health Treatment by People of Color (2014). This article

described “Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health” and a “Lack of Cultural

Competency in Service Delivery.” Mental health consumers of color were noted to

be negatively affected by the lack of cultural competence. To address these

disparities, NAMI provides three recommendations.
1. Collecting race and ethnicity data, which will identify major health disparities and
SOUICes.
2. Mental health providers adapting to meet the needs of people of color.
3. Performing cultural self-assessments, adopting cultural competence standards
and adapting services to meet current diverse patient needs.

e “Although no differences were noted on measures, the pairing of black Veterans
with white clinicians was associated with receiving fewer services. According to
some other measures, black Veterans received less intensive services
regardless of the clinician’s race” (Effect of Clinician-Veteran Racial Pairing in the
Treatment of PTSD - abstract conclusion).

e In 2008, the race/ethnicity of physicians in the U.S. was White - 7%, Black -
6.3%, Asian - 12%, Hispanic - 5.5%, and American Indian/Alaska Native - 0.5%.

of American Medical Colleges, page 17.

VHA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA agrees that mental health providers should have cultural competence training;
however, VHA continues to believe that this is already addressed in professional
graduate education and therefore, mandatory training for VHA mental heaith providers
is not necessary. As the Committee itself notes, “Cultural competence programs have
proliferated in U.S. medical schools in response to increasing national diversity, as well
as mandates from accrediting bodies” (2014 report, page 5). Additionally, beyond
training provided through professional graduate education programs, there are

| professional education materials already available to VA clinicians that address cultural
issues that are specific to Veterans. For example, VA’s National Center for
Posttraumatic-Stress Disorder (NCPTSD) has a series of educational materials for
providers on the needs of ethnic minority Veterans with PTSD.

13
",0,0,0,0
755,"These include:
e Combat on Many Fronts: Latino Veterans and Family Provider Perspectives:
e PTSD Among Asian-Pacific Islander Veterans: For Providers:
e War on Many Fronts: African American Veterans with PTSD: For Providers; and
e Wounded Spirits, Ailing Hearts, PTSD, and the Legacy of War among American

Indian and Alaska Native Veterans: For Health Care Providers.
This material is available here:
http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/materials/videos/index.asp.
There are also comparable materials for Veterans and families on the NCPTSD Web
site’s General Population Section.
In 2014, the VA/PTSD Work Group produced a video titled, ""A Partnership for Healing,”
to provide cultural and clinical information about needs of American Indian Veterans for
VA and Indian Health Service (IHS) clinicians. This video was placed on VA's Talent
Management System Web site and copies of the video were distributed to all VAMCs
and to IHS.
As an example of additional action related to clinical sensitivity to minority Veteran
needs (although not a specific cultural training activity), the VA/IHS Suicide Prevention
Work Group produced a version of VA’s Operation “Signs Ask Validate Encourage”
(SAVE) materials modified to meet the unique needs of American Indian and Alaska
Native Veterans based on input from stakeholder focus groups.
Recommendation #3: That the VA update the Schedule for Rating Disabilities
(Part 4, Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations) to accommodate medical research
on symptomatology of certain medical conditions which have particular
application to minority veterans of differing cultures.
Rationale: The ACMV included in their 2013 Annual Report a recommendation that the
Schedule for Rating Disabilities be updated. As that update has not yet been
accomplished, and as the need for such a program was validated during the ACMV
2014 on-site visit to the New York VA Regional Office, this recommendation is
resubmitted.
The Schedule for Rating Disabilities was first implemented in 1946. Over the last 65
years, significant advances have been made in the identification and understanding of
certain illnesses that may be more symptomatic to minority veterans (Such as
hypertension, PTSD, diabetes, cancers, and sleep apnea). An updated rating schedule
and diagnostic codes may more accurately and fairly award service-connection for
certain medical conditions afflicting minority Veterans.
VA Response: Concur

14
",0,0,0,0
756,"VBA concurs with the recommendation to update the VA Schedule for Rating
Disabilities (VASRD). In 2009, VBA’s Under Secretary for Benefits, on behalf of the
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, directed the revision and update of the 15 body systems
that are contained in the VASRD, 38 C.F.R. § 4, under the authority of 38 United States
Code (U.S.C.) § 1155. The revised criteria will apply to all Veterans.
The update of the VASRD regulations, already underway, will apply current medical
science and econometric earnings loss data to provide VA with a more accurate rating
system. These updates will ensure that Veterans with service-connected diseases or
injuries, including minority Veterans, are compensated based on modern standards.
The review of each VASRD body system occurs in three phases. The working group
researches and analyzes every current diagnostic code within each body system, as
well as disabilities not currently listed in the VASRD. These working groups have
considered a wide range of pertinent medical research and other data. During the
development phase, regulation writers draft the working groups’ recommended changes
into proposed regulations. In the concurrence phase, subject matter experts and
leadership review each proposed regulation for publication in the Federal Register.
VBA currently aims to complete the reviews of each body system by December 2016.

Recommendation #4: That the VA direct all VA National Cemeteries prominently
Display the District of Columbia and insular flags of all United States territories as
they do flags from the 50 states.
Rationale: At the 2014 ACMV site visit to the Long Island VA National Cemetery, it
was noted that the District of Columbia and United States territorial flags were not
displayed along with those of the 50 states. The Cemetery Director acknowledged that
those territorial flags were on-hand, but there was insufficient space for the territorial
flags. While a new, more inclusive display of state and territorial flags will be displayed
at the Long Island National Cemetery, the example in New York may indicate that other
VA national cemeteries may either not have territorial flags on-hand or may not display
those flags.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, Title V- Military Personnel
Policy, Subtitle J - Other Matters, Section 588, provides a provision requiring the armed
services to display the District of Columbia flag and the flags of the territories whenever
the flags of the 50 states are displayed. Veterans from the District of Columbia and |
U.S. Territories (District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American
Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands) were instrumental in
various conflicts that involved U.S. military action. Given the honorable service of past,
current, and future service members (and their eligible family members) from the District
of Columbia and United States territories whose last resting place may be a VA national
cemetery, etiquette and protocol demands that the flags of those territories be
prominently displayed.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle

16
",0,0,0,0
758,"NCA appreciates the recommendation of the ACMV concerning displaying the flags of
the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia at VA national cemeteries. NCA agrees
that flying the flags of the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia would recognize
the service and sacrifices of Veterans and Service members who are residents of the
nation’s capital, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa
and the U.S. Virgin Islands. NCA Directive 3220, “Flags in VA National Cemeteries,”
generally provides that, “The United States of America flag and the National League of
Families POW/MIA flag are the only two flags authorized for daily public display in VA
national cemeteries.” NCA authorizes limited exceptions to this policy; however,
paragraph 10d of the states: “Cemeteries may display all State flags as part of the
special events for Memorial Day and Veterans Day if the cemetery has the facilities to
do so.” All State flags must be included, and they all must be raised and lowered on
that day.” Out of VA’s 131 national cemeteries, 27 national cemeteries display State
flags on special occasions. Most of these cemeteries purchased the state flags:
however, many cemeteries also received the flags as donations from cemetery support
committees, Veteran Service Organizations and scout groups. NCA will issue a field
notice and update the NCA Directive 3220 to state: “For the purposes of this directive,
the term State flags include the flags of all 50 states of the United States of America and
the flags of the United States territories and the District of Columbia.” The change will
result in some cost to donors, or to the cemeteries that will purchase the additional
flags. Some cemeteries that elect to continue to fly State flags will be required to
construct additional flag poles to display the flags of the fifty states, the U.S. territories,
and the District of Columbia. Accordingly, implementation of this recommendation is
subject to the availability of funds.

Recommendation #5: Recommend that VHA provide the Office of Health Equity
(OHE) with a budget that allocates adequate funding to support projects that align
with achieving OHE mission and goals.
Rationale: The Office of Health Equity was established in 2012 to support the VHA
vision to provide appropriate individualized health care to each Veteran in a way that
eliminates disparate health outcomes and assures health equity. OHE currently only
has dedicated funding to support Full Time Employee Equivalent (FTEE).
VA Response: Concur
In March 2013, the Under Secretary for Health increased OHE’s budget by $1,026,961,
bringing OHE’s total program office budget to $2,382,961. The anticipated FY 2015
budget for OHE is $2,126,700. The difference from FY 2014 is due to further budget
cuts across VHA Central Office program offices in support of the VHA access crisis.
The FY 2015 budget will cover OHE staff salary and support projects that align with
achieving OHE mission and goals. As VHA operationalizes the Health Equity Action
Plan, additional funds and/or resources maybe needed for full implementation.
Recommendation #6: Recommend that the Veterans Health Administration
conduct an assessment of the impact that prolonged clinic wait times have had
on access to care by minority Veterans at selected facilities with large minority
Veteran populations.
Rationale: Since 1996, the ACMV has conducted site visits at VHA facilities around the
United States, with large minority Veteran populations. The Advisory Committee on
Minority Veterans reviewed the results of the recent results of the VA Access Audit of
clinic wait times. Many of the former ACMV site visit locations had high wait times. For
example, in VISN 21, Honolulu had the highest wait time in the nation. In 2012, the
ACMV visited Harlingen, Texas, VA Texas Valley Costal Bend Health Care System area
in VISN 17; and in 1999 and 2005 the ACMV visited the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
area in VISN 8. Both of these facilities had the highest wait times in their VISNs.
Minority Veterans experience many challenges that make access to appropriate and
timely healthcare services essential.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VHA concurs-in-principle in the need to assess the impact that prolonged clinic wait
times have had on access to care by minority Veterans. VHA recently conducted a

18
",0,0,0,0
760,"nationwide access audit to ensure a full understanding of VA’s policies and
management of patient access to care. The initial summary was released on May 30,
2014, and it acknowledged that we have systemic issues that need to be addressed.
The audit did not identify Veterans by race or ethnicity. It is not mandatory that a
Veteran identify their race or ethnicity on any VA form, and so, VA is not able to assess
the impact that prolonged clinic wait time may have specifically to minority Veterans.
The final results of the nationwide access audit were released on June 9, 2014, and
they confirmed widespread problems with appointment scheduling across the country.
VHA also released specific, facility-level information related to average wait times and
numbers of appointment requests that have not yet been scheduled. National audit and
patient access data are available to review at www.va.gov/health/access-audit.asp.
Although VHA has made efforts to address health care appointment scheduling and
wait times for health care, further improvement is needed. On May 23, 2014, VHA
executed the Accelerating Access to Care Initiative, a coordinated, nationwide initiative
to accelerate care to Veterans throughout the VA system and in communities where
Veterans reside. This initiative is designed to increase timely access to care for
Veterans; decrease the number of Veterans waiting for their care; and standardize the
process and tools for ongoing monitoring and access management at VA facilities. VHA
will continue to accelerate access to care for Veterans nationwide, utilizing care both
within the VA system and local communities.
VA will work together with Veterans Service Organizations, Congress, and all VA
stakeholders to restore the trust of Veterans and the American people by providing
quality health care in a timely manner. VA will continue to keep you apprised as we
make changes to ensure that all of our eligible Veterans get the timely medical care
they have earned and deserve.

The ACMV hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting at the Bronx Community College.
Attendance was low due to very adverse weather conditions including severe thunder
storms and associated flooding in the area. The town hall provided a venue for
Veterans’ questions and comments. It also provided locai VA officials an opportunity to
provide updates on current initiatives in their catchment areas. Local VA officials from
the New York VARO, James J. Peters (Bronx) VAMC, and Calverton National Cemetery
joined the Advisory Committee at this event. Veterans in attendance expressed
concern about the recent news concerning VA clinic wait times. Veterans also asked
the Committee to express their desire for an expansion of services at the St. Albans VA
facility in the borough of Queens. They also identified a need for sensitivity to the
requirements of women Veterans and assistance for homeless Veterans in Nassau
County. Several statements were also made that highlighted that Veterans from the
World War Il, Korea, and Vietnam eras were not aware of the full scope of VA benefits
and services.

*Additional Update as of July 2014
Prior Responses: ACMV 2013 Recommendations, Rationales, and VA Responses
Recommendation #4: That the VA Office of Human Resources and
Administration develop a methodology to determine the reasons/causes of
removals/terminations (regrettable losses) of recently hired Veterans by the end

of Fiscal Year 2014.
Rationale: According to the Fiscal Year 2012 Veterans Hire Demographics,
Separations report, there were a total of 6,747 removals, resignations and terminations
from VA employment. In the briefings presented, the reasons for this high number was
unknown. Therefore, VA needs identify to why 40% of newly hired Veterans leave VA
employment within 12 months of being hired. Although the latest unemployment rates
for Veterans are improving, minority Veterans continue to lag behind in terms of
| employment. Therefore, it becomes important for VA to focus on its retention of
Veterans.
A review of several studies which addressed employee retention indicated that
recruiting and hiring a new employee could range from 50-150% of the annual salary of
a retained employee. Therefore, retention is crucial in containing recruitment costs,
while significantly contributing to lowering unemployment rates of deserving Veterans.
30
",0,0,0,0
772,"Further reported research for companies that used exit interviews or questionnaires with
departing employees revealed the following information: the primary reasons for
leaving were poor relationships and/or communications with one's supervisor, poor
quality of co-worker or customer relationships, need for more work/life balance and low
levels of employee engagement.
VA Response: Concur
As stated in the 2011 Action Plan Recommendation #4*, Veterans Employment
services Office (VESO) provided an update and status report to the ACMV. VESO has
reviewed Veterans employment data and has contracted to have a Veterans Retention
Study completed by first quarter of FY 2014.

Recommendation #5: That VA expedite the collection and analysis of
demographic data on minority Veterans to determine if disparities exists in the
top five claimed conditions, grant rate for disability claims, and percentages of
disability granted, and publish a report similar to the review that was recently
completed on women Veterans by 2015.
Rationale: The availability and utilization of race/ethnic data will assist the VA to
respond to the requirements of 38 U.S.C. section 544(c), which requires the ACMV to
make “such recommendations (including recommendations for administrative and
legislative action) as the Committee considers appropriate, and 38 U.S.C. section
317(d)(5), which will assist the Center for Minority Veterans to “conduct and sponsor
appropriate research on the needs of Veterans who are minorities and to the extent to
which programs authorized under this title meet the needs of those Veterans, without
regard to any law concerning the collection of information from the public’. Until
recently representative race/ethnicity data was not available. VA has developed
methodology to collect demographic data which should provide an opportunity to
conduct preliminary reviews.
In town hall meetings in Chicago, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; and Fayetteville, North
Carolina; minority Veterans have expressed the opinion that they feel that the
percentage levels that they receive for disability, especially PTSD claims are

31
",0,0,0,0
773,"significantly lower than that received by non-minority Veterans. VA officials during
these town hall sessions have been able to describe the process of assessing disability
levels, but have not been able to present actual data that would dispel this belief of
potential disparities. The publication of a VA report would prove valuable in dispelling
long standing perceptions of minority Veterans regarding the disability rating process.
VA Response: Concur-in-principle
VBA concurs-in-principle with the recommendation regarding the importance of
analyzing factors that could contribute to differences in disability compensation
awards. In 2009, VBA contracted with IDA to study such differences, including
differences among minority Veterans. IDA’s report demonsirates the complexity of
conducting such an analysis.
IDA pointed out that differences in average compensation do not necessarily imply
unequal treatment of Veterans, and that answering the question of disparities or
unequal treatment requires first examination of the factors that lead to a
compensation award, and then determination of which of these factors are explained
by characteristics of the Veterans and their applications rather than by VBA
Judgments and decisions. VBA believes that any demographic analysis conducted in
the future should again be conducted by an expert analytical organization such as
IDA.
OPP may be able to assist VBA in an empirical analysis to determine if there is any
evidence to support the perception of racial disparity in disability claims. OPP is
reviewing race and ethnicity information available to the Department in an effort to
determine its suitability for use in analysis. If OPP determines that it has reasonable
data on race and ethnicity, staff can link it with VBA claims and award information to
examine the perception of racial disparity.
Pending: OPP has received data from VBA’s Office of Performance Analysis and
Integrity regarding the top five disabilities claimed by Veterans and will need to continue
testing to determine if this data is sufficient to address the concerns noted in the
recommendation.

Recommendation #9: VA regional administrators should monitor staff
recruitment efforts with a goal of hiring staff that are diverse and reflective of the
Veteran population.
Rationale #9: There are approximately 10,000 Native American Veterans and 12,000
Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans in the Texas area, therefore special emphasis
should be placed on targeting recruitment efforts to increase the employment of
Veterans of these ethnicities. Few individuals of these ethnic backgrounds are currently
employed by the VA in the Texas area.
NCA Response: Concur
As a part of the MVPCs normal outreach duties, they provide Veterans a copy of NCA’s
brochure with information on how to apply for employment opportunities at NCA. In
FY 2012, NCA offices nationwide have participated in several outreach events
specifically targeting Native American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander
Veterans. As a practice, NCA utilizes these opportunities for recruitment to further
diversify the workforce as well as increasing minority participation in the services and
benefits that we provide. Some of the measures NCA has taken to improve Native
American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans’ participation so far in
FY 2012 include the Under Secretary, Mr. Muro, as well as other NCA executives
serving as guest speakers at events focusing on outreach and recruitment of these
targeted groups, including the White House Asian American Pacific Islander
Roundtable, and the Tribal Governments Consultation in Washington, DC.
In addition, NCA has participated in outreach at events in Texas such as the Heroes
and Heritage Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio,
Texas; and the LULAC National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012, Hilton
Houston Oak, Houston, Texas. Through NDIP, NCA provides opportunities for students
from the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA), the Asian Pacific American
Institute for Congressional Studies (APAICS), and the International Leadership
Foundation (ILF) to gain Federal job experience for ten weeks. This program serves as
a very useful long-range recruiting tool. In FY 2012, several of the NDIP interns were
obtained through Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities outreach. NCA has
established partnerships with the ILF, APAICS, and OCA to sponsor students
throughout the year at various cemetery locations nationwide.
The Veterans Cemetery Grants Program conducts quarterly conference calls and
emails program updates to state cemeteries and other organizations about pending
grants. Individual conference calls have been conducted with Hawaii and Guam
providing guidance on their pending project; this initiative ensures funding and
additional employment opportunities for Asian American/Pacific Islander communities.
In FY 2012, two Tribal grants have been approved and another is pending.

The Honorable Robert A. McDonald :
secretary, Department of Veterans Affairs
810 Vermont Avenue, NW
Washington, D.C. 20420
Dear Secretary McDonald: , :
| am deeply grateful to serve as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans |
(ACMV). The enclosed 2015 Annual Report includes recommendations which reflect key 2
issues identified by the Committee through briefings received at VA Central Office; a site
visit to the VA facilities in the Seattle/Tacoma area and; feedback from the town hall meeting |
conducted at the VA Puget Sound HCS-American Lake Campus.
The ACMV's 2015 Annual Report Is aligned with the objectives of the My VA Initiative. Thus | |
focuses on improving the Minority Veterans experience, achieving support service excellence, :
ensuring that the Veteran is served in a culture of continuous performance improvement, |
enhancing strategic parinerships, and improving the employee experience by focusing on the
people and culture.
The Advisory Committee was established under PL 103-446 on November 2, 1994. Our |
responsibilities include:
- Advising the Secretary and Congress :

- Providing an annual report |

~ Meeting with VA Officials, Veterans Service Organizations, and Stakeholders

- Conducting periodic site visits and town hall meetings to address concerns of |
minority Veterans.

Our report addresses the unique needs of minority Veterans which provides a great
opportunity for the improvement of the delivery of services to them and their families. We |
present our recommendations in the SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Realistic and
Time iimited) format to ensure that we honer the guidance established by the Department of |
Veterans Affairs. As military demographics continue to change, the Veteran population will
become more diverse In terms of race and ethnicity. Based upon the concerns expressed by 2
minority Veterans, they continue to face many challenges within the VA system. Some of |
these challenges are described as follows: |
(1) Need for Demographic Data: An example of this is unpublished VA utilization information :
on minority Veterans. Comprehensive data analysis prepares the VA to become more
Veteran-Centric in the future. As the percentage of minorities increases in the overall |
Veteran population, this data will help leadership in the future to plan strategically to :
improve on utilization of services for minority Veterans. The Department’s response to our 2
2015 recommendation referring to race/ethnicity data indicates that the VA Office of Policy
and Planning (OPP) does not have the data needed to identify delivery gaps and potential
levels of service for all benefits and utilization programs. This data is currently not collected :

4 :
",1,0,0,0
791,", by OPP; the data is primarily collected from other federal agencies or purchased from |
commercial sources and :
data collected by VA program offices is incomplete. The Committee strongly encourages :
the Department to collect race/ethnicity data in a similar manner currently done by the
Defense Manpower Data Center and the U.S. Census Bureau. |

(2) Lack of Diversity in Senior Leadership: The Committee has expressed its concern for lack
of minorities in senior leadership positions 12 times in the past 20 years. The increasing
diversity of the Veteran population and understanding the My VA concept of being more i
Veteran-Centric, deepens the need for an aggressive program to increase diversity in the :
VA workforce. You will note that your staff did not disagree with our assessment that
further action needs to be taken to enhance diversity in the Department's senior leadership |
positions. |

(3) Timely Access to Services: An example of this was echoed during our town hail meeting at 2
the American Lake Campus. Veterans from Guam reported extreme hardships in
accessing VA healthcare in their homeland. To obtain appropriate healthcare, some of :
these individuals permanently moved from their Island homes to Washington State and !
California. It was also noted that there was a need to strengthen VBA services in the |
region as well. Comprehensive access initiatives need to be further developed to enhance :
the delivery of VA services to Veterans in insular areas.

(4) Lack of Awareness of VA Benefits and Services: It is evident that there are many minority |
Veterans and their families that are still unaware of what is available to them. An exampie 1
of this was highlighted during our town hall meeting when Veteran spouses exhibited 7
unfamiliarity with National Cemetery Administration (NCA) benefits. The Committee :
acknowledges that NCA has not published utilization data on minority Veterans. This |
reinforces the Committee's request for utilization : |

(5) data to ensure proper analysis of targeted outreach requirements can be measured to |
increase awareness. :

In closing, ACMV respectfully requests that briefings from VA entities include specific data :

and recommendations at the next ACMV meeting which is tentatively scheduled for October

2015 in Washington, DC. | extend the Committee’s special thanks to the staff of the Center for :

Minority Veterans for their continued outstanding support of the ACMV. :

On behalf of the Committee, | express my sincere appreciation for allowing us the privilege to |

serve the VA and our Nations minority Veterans. |
Sincerely,

4 =

792,"Part f. Executive Summary :
The 2015 Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the :
Committee's observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the effectiveness of the
Depariment of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans. The
report also provides Departmental responses and action plans to address the 2015 ACMV |
recommendations, and a summary of the progress made on action plans from the 2011, 2012, 2013
and 2014 ACMV reports. |
The ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in accordance |
with Public Law 103-446, and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans dated
March 27, 2014. The ACMV met on October 28-30, 2014, at VA Central Office (VACO), and |
conducted a site visit in the Seattle-Tacoma, Washington area from April 21-23, 2015. The meeting ;
at VACO, included briefings from Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits |
Administration (VBA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and select staff offices. |
Ex Officio members from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of |
Labor (DOL) provided briefings on their respective missions and services provided to minority |
Veterans during the VACO meeting. During the Seattle-Tacoma site visit, the ACMV received |
briefings and facility tours at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, the Seattle Regional Benefit 2
Office, the Seattle Vet Center, Tahoma National Cemetery, VA Puget Sound American Lake Campus, :
and the American Lake Sweatlodge. On the afternoon of April 22, 2015, the ACMV and |
_ representatives from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Tahoma National Cemetery, and :
Seattle Regional Benefit Office responded to questions from minority Veterans and provided updates |
on current VA initiatives during a town hall meeting.
Over the past year, the ACMV reviewed information received during our meetings with VA officials, |
conducted document reviews, and communicated directiy with minority Veterans. The Committee
strongly believes that the four 2015 recommendations will significantly enhance VA's ability to |
strategically address the needs of minority Veterans. These recommendations and rationales
address the following issues: |
® Enhancing data collection processes to include the reporting of race/ethnicity data. |
, ¢ Accelerate the efforts to improve the diversity of the workforce at the Senior Management level. :
* Develop a plan to improve access benefits and services for Veterans residing in the Pacific Rim, |
Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands.
e Enhance the awareness level of burial benefits by specifying on NCA’s website the !
availability of burial space by type and eligibility groups for each cemetery location. 2
",0,0,0,0
793,"Part Il. Summary of 2015 Recommendations :
Recommendation #1: That VA enhance its existing data collection processes to include the
reporting of race/ethnicity data for all benefits and utilization programs to ensure the identification of
delivery gaps and potential disparate levels of service. .
Recommendation #2: That VA accelerates efforts to improve the diversity of the workforce at the
GS-14, GS-15, and SES levels by establishing benchmarks when possible, and utilizing established
diversity management practices. , :
Recommendation #3: That VA develops an insular catchment area plan that includes service
delivery initiatives and benchmarks for the Pacific Rim, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. :
Recommendation #4: That NCA specify on its website availability of burial space by type and . |
eligibility groups for each cemetery location to enhance the awareness level of burial benefits for |
minority Veterans by the end of FY 2016. :
",0,0,0,0
794,", Part Ill. ACMV 2015 Recommendations, Rationales and VA Responses
Recommendation #1: That VA enhance its existing data collection processes to include the :
reporting of race/ethnicity data for all benefits and utilization programs to ensure the :

, identification of delivery gaps and potential disparate levels of service. |
Rationale: The Advisory Commitiee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) is required by 38 U.S.C., Section |
544, to submit an annual report to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. This report provides an
assessment of the needs of Veterans who are minority group members with respect to compensation, :
healthcare, rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and programs administered by the |
Department. ,
The ACMV has cited a need for additional data in past reports. The 2012 Minority Veterans Report, |
prepared by the National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics, dated September 2014, 3
provides a partial foundation for assessing the needs of minority Veterans. The Committee has been |
advised that another Minority Veterans Report, reflecting utilization, is under development but that
report has yet to be pubiished. |
Comprehensive data analysis prepares the Department to be more Veteran-Centric in the future as
the percentage of minorities in the overall Veteran population increases from 21% in 2012 to 34% in
2040, including minority women Veterans.
In the 2014 Annual Report, VHA’s response to ACMV’s Recommendation #6, that VA assess the | |
impact that prolong clinic wait times may have specifically on minority Veterans, reflected that it was
not possible to provide that assessment. It was further noted that it is not mandatory for Veterans to |
identify their race or ethnicity on any VA form. The National Cemetery Administration is not able to |
provide the ACMV data which reflects utilization of burial benefits by race and ethnicity. Therefore, 2
the level of targeted outreach needed to increase awareness of burial benefits programs is impossible |
to determine.
To execute the My VA Initiative calls for VA to be able to identify the race/ethnicity of veterans being
served. This has been a long standing practice of major healthcare systems. , 2
The recent Disabled American Veterans report, “Women Veterans: The Long Journey Home,” makes |
the following Key Recommendation #2 - The Federal government should collect, analyze and publish |
data by gender and minority status for every program that serves Veterans to improve understanding, 2
the monitoring and oversight of programs that serve women Veterans. :
If this recommendation was acted upon, the VA would be able to provide the ACMV with a |
comprehensive report on VA Benefits and services Utilization by Minority Veterans similar to the 2011 2
Military Service History and VA Benefit Utilization Statistics Women’s Veteran Report.
VA Response: Concur in Principle |
Concerning Race/Ethnicity Data: , |

¢ Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) does not collect race and ethnicity data from Veterans. |
e Race and ethnicity data in OPP’s possession is primarily collected by other federal entities, i
including the Defense Manpower Data Center and the U.S. Census Bureau.

e Race and ethnicity data collected by VA program offices is incomplete.
8
",0,0,0,0
795,"e Over time, the OMB definition for the race and ethnicity categories has changed. |
e Some race data and ethnicity data is purchased from a commercial source, but it too is |
Incomplete. |
Concerning the Identification of Delivery Gaps and Potential Disparate Levels of Service:
e OPP does not have the data needed to identify delivery gaps and potential disparate levels of :
service for all benefits and utilization programs.
Recommendation #1: OPP will provide the ACMV with a report on selected VA benefits and 2
services utilization by minority Veterans. :

Recommendation #2: That VA accelerates efforts to improve the diversity of the workforce at
the GS-14, GS-15, and SES levels by establishing benchmarks when possible, and utilizing |
established diversity management practices. |
Rationale: The ACMV has highlighted a lack of minorities in senior leadership positions over 12 |
times in the last 20 years. Approximately one-third of the VA workforce consists of Veterans. |
Aggressive action is required to address the long standing lack of diversity pattern that exists within :
the VA workforce structure. The Department has a comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion Strategic :
Plan. Some progress has been made in the quest to increase diversity at the senior leadership ;
levels. However, progress has not matched the increasing diversity of the VA workforce or the :
Veteran stakeholder population that is served by the Department. |
In 2003, the Government Accounting Office published GAO-03-34, Senior Executive Service, |
Enhanced Agency Efforts Needed to Improve Diversity as the Senior Corps Turns Over. The GAO :
anticipated that half of the 6,100 career SES members employed on October 2001 would leave
service by October 2007. Utilizing SES appointment trends at that time, the only significant changes
in diversity that was anticipated was an increase in the number of white women and essentially equal
decrease in white men. VA was one of the six agencies visited during the course of developing the
report. All of the agencies recognized that more would have to be done than in the past if diversity ;
was to be enhanced (Executive Summary). A review of the VA specific charts below reflects VA’s |
Race, Ethnicity, and Gender of SES, GS-14, and GS-15 as of October 2000, September 2003, and
september 2014 ( Sources: GAQ-03-34 and, MD 715 reporis 2003 and 2014).

Recommendaiion #3: The VA develops an insular catchment area plan that includes
enhanced service delivery initiatives and benchmarks for the Pacific Rim, Puerto Rico, and the
US Virgin islands. |
Rationale: The 2014-2015 Plan for the Pacific island Task force did not include the other insular __ |
service areas of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. These locales have overall majority minority
populations, unique geographical challenges, limited availability of specialty care services, and the
inability to utilize the Choice Card Program. The ACMV was provided the goals, agency objectives,
strategic activities and benchmarks for the 2014-2015 plans. However, the ACMV has yet to be :
provided a copy of the Pacific Rim site visit report. Veterans residing in the insular areas lack the :
option to use the Choice Card to alleviate delays in wait times for appointments or access to specialty ;
care and encounter challenges accessing other VA benefits and services. |
During our April 2015 ACMV site visit in the Seattle/Tacoma area, Veterans from Guam reported |
extreme hardships in accessing VA healthcare in their homelands. To obtain appropriate healthcare, |
some of these individuals permanently moved from their island homes to Washington State and |
California. Based on the questions that were asked during the Veterans town hall meeting and :
inquiries from Veterans residing in Guam, many Veterans were not aware of VA initiatives to enhance
their access to VA services. |
On May 12, 2015, Roscoe Butler Deputy Director of the American Legion’s Veteran Affairs and
Rehabilitation Division presented the Legions’ testimony before the House Committee on Veterans :
Atfairs Subcommittee concerning the Choice Card Program. He noted that,” during a recent |
Veterans Benefits Center (VBC) visit to Puerto to assess the healthcare system there, local Veterans
expressed the frustration they encountered when VHA staff insisted that no one on the island was ;
eligible for health care under the Choice Card Program because there is no medical facility that is
further than 40 miles from any VA geographic location on the Island.”

VBA Outreach: |
VBA is committed to providing outreach to Veterans, survivors, and eligible beneficiaries residing in |
remote of underserved areas; including but not limited to the Pacific Rim, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. :
Virgin Islands. VBA has designated a Minority Veteran Program Coordinator (MVPCs) at each VA
regional office (RO) who is responsible to providing outreach to Asian Pacific isianders, Hispanic,
African American, and Native American Veterans. The MVPCs have a comprehensive knowledge of |
VA programs and perform multiple outreach functions: they attend town hall meetings, and act as |
liaisons with Federal, state and local agencies, community stakeholders and service providers to |
increase minority Veterans’ awareness. MVPCs.also respond to the unique needs of minority :
_ Veterans and assist in developing strategies for increasing participation in existing VA benefits |
programs. |
VBA MVPCs partner heavily with their Veterans Health Administration (VHA), National Cemetery |
Administration (NCA) counterparts and the VHA Office of Rural Health to promote the use of VA |
benefits, programs and services by minority Veterans. VBA is committed to educating interna! staff 2
and external stakeholders about the unique needs of minority Veterans residing in remote locations. :
VBA participates in ongoing monthly conference calls with the Center for Minority Veterans (CMV),
and VHA to discuss outreach trends, and best practices for reaching Veteran populations that are :
underserved. VBA MVPCs from the Hawaii RO travel to remote islands that their office supports and |
the San Juan RO send representation to the US Virgin Islands; to conduct effective and efficient |
outreach to Veterans. , :
Additionally, VBAs Rural Outreach Program Manager (ROPM), pariners with the Mobile Vet Center, |
County Veteran Service Officer, Transition Assistance Advisors and Community Faith Based
Organizations to perform outreach to Veterans residing in remote locations. The ROPM coordinates |
outreach support for events hosted in rural communities, such as local libraries, job/career fairs,
health fairs and rural community forums. Activities at these events include but are not limited to
assistance with eBenefits registration, claims assistance and providing comprehensive information on |
benefits and services. VBA has improved its outreach and benefits counseling to align with the VA :
Secretary's goal of empowering Veterans to improve their well-being. VBA is also in the process of :
implementing a new Rural Outreach Coordinator position in each of it 56 regional offices as an |
additional effort to increase its outreach to Veterans in remote areas.
While VBA’s efforts to reach Veterans in rural areas have been steadfast, there is always opportunity
for improvement. VBA will continue to increase outreach-hours and improve partnerships with
Veterans service organizations, other organizations within VA, and other federal, state, and local .
partners.
Improved Access:
In addition to in-person outreach, Veterans now have improved access to benefits information from
multiple channels — on the phone, online, and through our shared Department of Defense (DoDV/VA
portal eBenefits. From FY 2009 to FY 2015, the number of contacts with VA through these channels :
increased from 9.1 million to more than 68.3 million.
",0,0,0,0
802,"Currently, VA has over 5 million eBenefits users. With over 55 self-service options, users can file
benefit claims online in an easy-to-use, prompt-based system. Veterans can also upload supporting
Claims information that feeds into VA’s paperless claims processing system; intent to file, fully
developed claims filing, check the status of claims or appeals; review their VA payment history; and |
obtain military documents, among other actions. ,
The Stakeholder Enterprise Portal (SEP) is a secure, Web-based entry point that complements :
- e@Benefits and gives Veterans service organizations and other authorized advocates access to assist :
Veterans with electronic claim submissions. Using the portal, registered users can check the status
of claims, review payment history, and upload documentation on behalf of the Veterans they
represent — all within a digital environment. :
Telephone systems improvements have also increased access to benefits information and services. !
Eight call centers now utilize a consolidated queue to improve efficiency and utilization of call agents. |
The consolidated queue allows calls to be routed to the next available agent with the appropriate skill |
set. Veterans and other callers have also benefited from the Virtual Hold feature, which automatically : |
calls the individual back. Additionally, callers have the option to pick a date and time for VA to call! |
back. |
VBA has also improved the tools call agents use. Unified Desktop technology at the National Call |
Centers combined 13 separate applications into one consolidated view of the Veteran. Call agents |
can now access the caller's contact history and utilize “smart scripts” to provide quick, consistent, and :
high-quality responses to callers. |

VHA Response: Concur -
The VA Pacific Islands Health Care System has been privileged to provide medical care services to ,
Guam’s Veterans since the early 1980s. From an initial staff of 5 we have grown to 48 staff
members, including 10 physicians, both on board and planned, caring for approximately 3,860 :
[7 3
",0,0,0,0
804,"enrolled Guam Veterans. The VA Guam Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC), located next to
the Naval Hospital in Hagatna, provides primary care, menta! health, women’s health care, specialty
care such as Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Podiatry, and Polytrauma/Traumatic Brain Injury (TBD 2
services, both on island by visiting VA providers, and through tele health, and home based primary 2
care services. For example, teledermatology is also provided by Dermatologists at the San Francisco :
VA. VA also has agreements with the Navai Hospital for emergency care, acute inpatient care, and
some specialty services. Some Veterans requiring off island referrals such as to Oahu and Tripler |
Army Medical Center are assisted, if eligible, by VA Beneficiary Travel support to help defray costs. i
In FY 14 for instance there were 479 trips totaling $ 1.43M. These include both commercial air and
special air ambulance transporiation.
Currently, the provision of primary care services is accomplished by two permanent primary care |
providers, and the equivalent of two more providers via visiting physicians. We have one newly hired |
replacement provider starting in mid-October and for the past six months experienced VA providers !
from Honolulu have provided care at the clinic. Contracted physician support is also available if :
needed, There will be no interruption of primary care services during this period. With this new hire :
five dedicated primary care providers will be furnishing care at the CBOC. 2
Mental health services ait the CBOC are currently provided by two psychiatrists, a nurse practitioner, i
social worker and a psychologist position under recruitment. Services include psychiatric evaluations, |
medication management and a wide range of evidenced based psychotherapies. Individual and ;
group therapy is provided for care of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anger management, :
stress management and coping skills for Veterans with substance abuse disorders and PTSD. :
The award of a VA Office of Rural Health grant has enabled us to begin offering Veterans VA ,
delivered primary and mental health care services more conveniently in both the North and South |
Guam areas. The Team cares for Veterans twice weekly at existing community health centers and
includes a primary care provider, psychiatrist, registered nurse, and a medical support assistant. |
Our home based primary care services involving a physician, nurse practitioner, registered nurses, |
social worker, and an occupational therapist provide care to approximately thirty-five Veterans with 2
medically complex needs in the comfort of their own homes. 2
Other new faces at the CBOC will include a pharmacist under recruitment, dividing their time between :
the CBOC and Naval Hospital, for education and consultation both with Veterans and staff, a social
worker on-board conducting outreach and improved coordination of services for our newest Veterans !
from Operations Enduring Freedom/traqi Freedom/New Dawn, along with a Diabetes Nurse Educator
and a Nurse Care Coordinator within the hospital. a
Other on-island VA services involve our Homeless Veteran Program including two social workers and :
two peer specialists who provide outreach, case management, and referral services. The Housing
and Urban Development - VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) program provides thirty-six vouchers ,
to assist eligible Veterans to obtain housing. We are also working toward the establishment of a five-
bed emergency housing program and a Veterans’ Treatment Court, 2
VA officials have also met recently with the University of Guam Department Heads and are seeking to :
establish traineeships which will allow University of Guam students in the programs of nursing, social 7
work and public health disciplines such as pre physical therapy, nutrition and health promotion to gain 2
valued experience at the CBOC, and in Homecare and Outreach Settings.

_ multidisciplinary team approach and we encourage Veterans to be an active participant in their ;
healthcare via computer by visiting MyHealtheVet.com where they can utilize secure messaging to :
communicate health needs to their provider, check on their appointments, refill prescriptions and :
obiain other useful information. :
We've come a long way from our inception in the 1980s and all the VA staff in Guam and Honolulu

are working to address any confusion about eligibility for Choice in these locations. Steps we are
taking to reduce confusion and increase use of the VCP are reflected in the task chart below:
Unlike the above-listed territories, Puerto Rico has a VA medical facility that provides hospital care,
emergency services, and surgical care having a surgical complexity of standard. Veterans in Puerto !
Rico are eligible for VCP if VA is unable to provide an appointment within the wait-time goals of VHA, |
reside more than 40 miles driving distance from the closet VA medical facility, need to travel by plane |
or boai to that facility, or face an unusual or excessive burden in traveling to that facility. Recent
amendments to VACAA provide VA greater flexibility to determine eligibility based on burden in travel. |

State and territorial cemeteries have been established in Guam, Saipan, Aguadilla and Puerto Rico.
NCA provides headstones, markers, and Presidential Memorial Certificates to the U.S. Virgin Islands |
and to any deceased eligible Veteran in any cemetery around the world. Currently, NCA has two 2
applications pending for the establishment of territorial cemeteries in the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. 2
Thomas and St. Croix); however, they are not actionable at this time because legislation has not been
approved and the two territories have not set aside the 10 percent matching funds required by CFR
38 Part 39. NCA also plans to expand burial services to Veterans in Puerto Rico by opening a facility |
in Morovis by 2020. The cemetery will provide a national! cemetery burial option to Veterans for |
decades. |

Recommendation #4: NCA specify on its website availability of burial space by type and :
eligibility groups for each cemetery location to enhance the awareness level of burial benefits 2
for minority Veterans by the end of FY 2016. |
Rationale: The ACMV has highlighted the need for additional targeted outreach and NCA has |
constantly made efforts to increase this outreach. The ability of NCA officials at national cemeteries
to conduct targeted outreach to minority Veterans is hampered by the size of their geographical | |
catchment areas, the small number of individuals assigned at these locations, and their constant |
workload. |
On the VA website, individual VA national cemeteries indicate their available capacity by indicating :
“Burial Space - This cemetery has space available to accommodate casketed and cremated
remains.” Note: This is generally the first place that eligible beneficiaries look for information on |
national cemeteries in their area. :
At the recent Veterans town hall meeting conducted by the ACMV, only approximately half of those
attending were aware that Veteran spauises and in some cases, dependent children were eligible for |
burial in national cemeteries. Individuals stated that after hearing that spouses and in some cases, :
21 :
",0,0,0,0
808,"| dependent children of Veterans could be buried in national cemeteries, that they would now consider
that option.
Making the suggested change to the NCA web sites would be a workload neutral effort that provides |
an additional means of raising awareness of burial benefits. :

817,"— Part Vi. Town Hall Meeting - Tacoma, Washington :
The ACMV hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting at the VA Puget Sound HCS-American Lake !
Division. Attendance was high with approximately 75 attendees. The town hall provided a venue for
Veterans questions and comments. It also provided local VA officials an opportunity to provide :
Veterans updates on current initiatives in their catchment areas. Local VA officials from the VA Puget :
Sound Health Care System, Seattle Regional Benefit Office, and Tahoma National Cemetery, joined |
the Advisory Committee at this event. Veterans in attendance expressed concern about the lack of
adequate health care services for Veterans in Guam. Many Veterans were frustrated with the WWII 2
Filipino Compensation Fund because family members were concerned that WWII Filipino Veterans |
will die prior to obtaining approval of benefits earned through the Compensation Fund. They also ,
ideniified a need for more targeted outreach, and showed an interest in more research on Mental :
Health issues on minority Veterans. Several statements were also made that referenced Veteran
reimbursement for emergency care sought outside of the VA Healthcare System, travel claim |
payments and mileage reimbursement should be via the Veterans bank account or personal check
mailing process, homeless Veterans need coordination of services which includes single male
parents with children, and spouses of Veterans were not aware of their eligibility for burial in national
cemeteries. :

include other agencies during their outreach events. |
e Reference strategy in reducing wait times — In primary care, have 75,000 patients, an issue |
can be keeping their doctors (Primary Care doctors) on staff — competing for doctors with the
whole nation. Allowing float positions — having doctors help in other positions. |
e Reference Choice Cards to reduce those wait times — utilization of the Choice Cards has not
met VHA’s expectations. Success is at 21% - Choice Card is working for a lot of Veterans but |
there is a lot of Veterans who are not using the Choice Card — the process does take long. :
Have a Choice Card Call Center which is a local initiative — need to make the Choice Card Call |
Center a national initiative.

NCA Response: Concur |
On July 17, 2014, the NCA EEO Office conducted an outreach communications plan meeting. |
Attending parties included the NCA MVPC Liaison, the NCA EEO Director, the NCA Outreach
Coordinator, and a representative from the Center for Minority Veterans. Items discussed during the
meeting included: providing NCA MVPC’s with a listing of other MVPC’s in their catchment areas as i
a method to increase outreach opportunities to Minority Veterans and to improve the efficient usage
of Departmental outreach resources, and providing NCA MVPC’s with a quarterly outreach ,
opportunities listing in order to increase the level of outreach to minority Veterans. Other discussion
points included having MVPC’s from the different administrations form outreach teams to formulate |
outreach strategies and share materials to disseminate at outreach events. Finally, MVPCs will be
required to include collaborations with VHA and VBA counterparts on the operations plans included
with the MVPC Quarterly Reports. |

Recommendation #4: That the VA Office of Human Resources and Administration develop a |
methodology to determine the reasons/causes of removals/terminations (regrettable losses) of
recently hired Veterans by ihe end of Fiscal Year 2014.
Rationale: According to the Fiscal Year 2012 Veterans Hire Demographics, Separations report,
there were a total of 6,747 removals, resignations and terminations from VA employment. In the ,
briefings presented, the reasons for this high number were unknown. Therefore, VA needs identify to
why 40% of newly hired Veterans leave VA employment within 12 months of being hired. Although
the latest unemployment rates for Veterans are improving, minority Veterans continue to lag behind in
terms of employment. Therefore, it becomes important for VA to focus on its retention of Veterans. :
* , |
",0,0,0,0
825,"A review of several studies which addressed employee retention indicated that recruiting and hiring a
new employee could range from 50-150% of the annual salary of a retained employee.5,6 Therefore,
retention is crucial in containing recruitment costs, while significantly contributing to lowering
unemployment rates of deserving Veterans.
Further reported research for companies that used exit interviews or questionnaires with departing
employees revealed the following information: the primary reasons for leaving were poor
relationships and/or communications with one's supervisor, poor quality of co-worker or customer
relationships, need for more work/life balance and low levels of employee engagement.
VA Response: Concur
As stated in the 2011 Action Plan Recommendation 4*, Veterans Employment Services Office |
(VESO) provided an update and status report to the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans ,
(ACMV). VESO has reviewed Veterans employment data and has contracted to have a Veterans |
Retention Study completed by first quarter of Fiscal Year 2014. |

“VA Response: A Retention Study was conducted and completed by VESO (contractor PDR!) and |
as a result of the findings from this study; a Veterans Retention Working was sanctioned by the
Assistant Secretary in April of 2015 with the following objectives: | :
1) Develop, integrate and coordinate pians to identify Veteran staff retention issues/gaps. |
2) Develop, integrate and coordinate strategies and high level plans for increased Veteran staff
retention. |
| Status: The Veterans Retention Working Group will provide the Assistant Secretary of HR&A an |
overview and recommendations to increase Veteran retention at the beginning of the first quarter of
FY16. |
Recommendation # 5; That VA expedite the collection and analysis of demographic data on !
minority Veterans to determine if disparities exists in the top five claimed conditions, grant rate for
disability claims, and percentages of disability granted, and publish a report similar to the review that
was recently completed on women Veterans by 2015.
Rationale: The availability and utilization of race/ethnic data will assist the VA to respond to the |
requiremenis of 38 U.S.C. section 544(c), which requires the ACMV to make “such recommendations 2
39
",0,0,0,0
826,"(including recommendations for administrative and legislative action) as the Committee considers

appropriate, and 38 U.S.C. section 317(d)(5), which will assist the Center for Minority Veterans to

“conduct and sponsor appropriate research on the needs of Veterans who are minorities and to the

extent to which programs authorized under this title meet the needs of those Veterans, without regard

to any law concerning the collection of information from the public”. Uniil recently representative

race/ethnicity data was not available. VA has developed methodology to collect demographic data

which should provide an opportunity to conduct preliminary reviews.

In town hall meetings in Chicago, Illinois; San Antonio, Texas; and Fayetteville, North Carolina;

minority Veterans have expressed the opinion that they feel that the percentage levels that they

receive for disability, especially PTSD claims are significantly iower than that received by non-minority

Veterans. VA officials during these town hall sessions have been able to describe the process of

assessing disability levels, but have not been able to present actual data that would dispel this belief

of potential disparities. The publication of a VA report would prove valuable in dispelling long |

standing perceptions of minority Veterans regarding the disabiitty rating process.

VA Response: Concur-in-Principle

VBA concurs-in-principle with the recommendation regarding the importance of analyzing factors that |

could contribute to differences in disability compensation awards. In 2009, VBA contracted with IDA

to study such differences, including differences among minority Veterans. IDA’s report demonstrates |

the complexity of conducting such an analysis. | |

IDA pointed out that differences in average compensation do not necessarily imply unequal treatment

of Veterans, and that answering the question of disparities or unequal treatment requires first

examination of the factors that lead to a compensation award, and then determination of which of |

these factors are explained by characteristics of the Veterans and their applications rather than by

VBA judgments and decisions. VBA believes that any demographic analysis conducted in the future |

shouid again be conducted by an expert analytical organization such as IDA. |

OPP may be able to assist VBA in an empirical analysis to determine if there is any evidence to

support the perception of racial! disparity in disability claims. OPP is currently reviewing race and

ethnicity information available to the Department in an effort to determine its suitability for use in :

analysis. if OPP determines that it has reasonable data on race and ethnicity, staff can link it with

VBA claims and award information to examine the perception of racial disparity.

Pending: OPP has received data from VBA’s Office of Performance Analysis and Integrity regarding |

the top five disabilities claimed by Veterans and will need to continue testing to determine if this data

is sufficient to address the concerns noted in the recommendation.

Recommendation #9: VA regional administrators should monitor staff recruitment efforts with a goal |
of hiring staff that are diverse and reflective of the Veteran population.
Rationale: There are approximately 10,000 Native American Veterans and 12,000 Asian
American/Pacific Islander Veterans in the Texas area, therefore special emphasis should be placed
on targeting recruitment efforts to increase the employment of Veterans of these ethnicities. Few
individuals of these ethnic backgrounds are currently employed by the VA in the Texas area.
NCA Response: Concur
As a part of the MVPCs normal outreach duties, they provide Veterans a copy of NCA’s brochure with |
information on how to apply for employment opportunities at NCA. In FY 2012, NCA offices |
nationwide have participated in several outreach events specifically targeting Native American
Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans. As a practice, NCA utilizes these |
opportunities for recruitment to further diversify ihe workforce as weil as increasing minority
participation in the services and benefits that we provide. Some of the measures NCA has taken to |
improve Native American Veterans and Asian American/Pacific Islander Veterans’ participation so far
in FY 20712 include the Under Secretary, Mr. Muro, as well as other NCA executives serving as guest
speakers at events focusing on outreach and recruitment of these targeted groups, including the |
_ White House Asian American Pacific Islander Roundtable, and the Tribal Governments Consultation 7
in Washington, DC.
In addition, NCA has participated in outreach at events in Texas such as the Heroes and Heritage |
Program/Career Fair, February 27, 2012, Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio, Texas, and the LULAC
National Women’s Conference, April 13-14, 2012, Hilton Houston Oak, Houston, Texas. Through |
NDIP, NCA provides opportunities for students from the Organization of Chinese Americans (OCA),
the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressionai Studies (APAICS), and the International
Leadership Foundation (ILF) to gain Federal job experience for ten weeks. This program serves as a
very useful long range recruiting tool. In FY 2012, several of the NDIP intems were obtained through :
Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) outreach. NCA has established
partnerships with the ILF, APAICS, and OCA to sponsor students throughout the year at various
cemetery locations nationwide. |
The Veterans Cemetery Grants Program conducts quarterly conference calls and e-mails program
updates to state cemeteries and other organizations about pending grants. Individual conference |
calls have been conducted with Hawaii and Guam providing guidance on their pending project; this
initiative ensures funding and additional employment opportunities for Asian American/Pacific |
Islander communities. In FY 2012, two Tribal grants have been approved and another is pending.

845,"Letter from the Advisory Committee Chair
Dear Secretary McDonald:
| am deeply grateful to serve as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans
(ACMV). The enclosed 2016 Annual Report includes recommendations which reflect key issues
identified by the Committee. The members developed this report based on their individual knowledge
and experiences; briefings received at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Central Office; a site
visit to the Jacksonville, Florida area VA facilities; and feedback from a Town Hall Meeting conducted
at the University of Florida Learning Resource Center Auditorium.
Current and past ACMV recommendations compliment the MyVA initiatives, and specifically focus on
the breakthrough priorities of improving the experiences of Veterans and employees. These internal
and external facing efforts promote efficient operations, and ensure Veterans are provided the same
level of services, regardless of age, gender, period of service, sexual preference, place of residence,
or a combination of these categories. The Committee recognizes and appreciates that individual
needs are not always met by a one-size fits all customer focused model.
The Committee’s past reports have highlighted the ongoing concern that the Department does not
collect race and ethnicity data, and this remains a significant issue given the changing demographics
and increasing diversity of the Veterans’ population. The recent Commission on Care report and one
of our 2016 recommendations provide sound rationales for gathering and analyzing comprehensive
demographic data. Accurate data is required to support the Committee’s mandated responsibility and
assessment of the needs of minority Veterans with respect to compensation, health care,
rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and programs administered by the Department. The
consistent tracking of such data will also ensure the Department's success in “Improving the Veterans
Experience”, for all Veterans. The Committee applauds VA’s efforts to match demographic data from
other Federal agencies. However, we encourage the Department to develop a formal race/ethnicity
data collection process that includes Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefit
Administration (VBA) and National Cemetery Administration (NCA) programs and services.
The Committee is disappointed that VHA has decreased its commitment to health equity at a time
when more minority Veterans are seeking medical treatment at its facilities. This is clearly evident
based upon the fact that the VHA Office of Health Equity staffing level has been reduced from 8
employees to 2 employees. The Commission on Care in its final report also addressed this issue in
recommendation #5. We encourage the Department to restore the Office of Health Equity to its
Original staffing level, and ensure that the Department’s Health Equity Action Pian is fully executed.
The Committee is encouraged by the Department’s ongoing progress in enhancing access to VA
benefits and services for all Veterans. We remain committed to assisting the Department in its efforts
to expand services to Veterans residing in rural and insular locations.

Sincerely,

Marvin A. Trujillo Jr.

846,"Part I. Executive Summary
The 2016 Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the
Committee's observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the effectiveness of the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans. The
report also provides Departmental responses and action plans to address the 2016 ACMV Annual
Report recommendations, and a summary of the progress made on action plans from the 2013, 2014
and 2015 ACMV Reports.
The ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in accordance
with Public Law 103-446, and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans dated
March 6, 2016. The ACMV met on December 1-3, 2015 at VA Central Office (VACO) and conducted
a site visit in the Jacksonville, Florida area from April 12-14, 2016. The meeting at VACO, included
briefings from Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA),
National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and select staff offices. Ex Officio members from the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Labor (DOL) provided briefings
on their respective missions and services provided to minority Veterans at the VACO meeting.
During the Jacksonville site visit, the ACMV received briefings and facility tours at the Lake City
Florida VA Medical Center (VAMC), Jacksonville National Cemetery, and Jacksonville Outpatient
Clinic. The Assistant Director of the St. Petersburg VA Regional Office accompanied the ACMV
during the entire site visit and provided a briefing on that facility. On the afternoon of April 13, 2016,
the ACMV and representatives from the Lake City VAMC, Jacksonville National Cemetery, and St.
Petersburg Regional Benefits Office responded to questions from minority Veterans and provided
updates on current VA initiatives during a town hall meeting conducted at the University of Florida
Leaning Resource Center Auditorium in Jacksonville.
The ACMV reviewed information received during meetings with VA officials, through document
reviews, and from direct communications with minority Veterans. The Committee strongly believes
that if implemented, the three 2016 recommendations will significantly enhance VA's ability to
strategically address the needs of minority Veterans as the Veterans population become more
diverse. These recommendations and rationales address the following issues:
e Contracting the publication of a report in depicting utilization and benefits, and adjudication of
disability compensation claims by race, ethnicity, and gender by the end of fiscal year (FY)
2017.
e Restoring VHA’s Office of Health Equity (OHE) to its original Full Time Equivalent (FTE)
staffing level of eight individuals
e Implementing a “targeted outreach” program for the surviving spouses and dependent children
who are eligible for burial benefits

848,"Part Ill. ACMV 2016 Recommendations, Rationales and VA Responses
Recommendation #1: That the Department of Veterans Affairs executes a contract to publish
a report which reflects current utilization of VA benefits and services, and disability
compensation awards by race, ethnicity, and gender by the end of Fiscal Year 2017.
Rationale: Minority Veterans have historically expressed concern that their disability compensation
claims may not be adjudicated fairly because of their race. The Department does not gather
demographic data as part of the claims adjudication process and to date has not been able to
address possible disparities in disability compensation awards based on race or ethnicity. Section
104(b){3) of the Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 directed the Secretary of Veterans
Affairs to report to the Congressional Veterans Committees on progress in addressing the causes of
variances in benefits to minority Veterans. In 2009, the Department contracted with the Institute for
Defense Analysis (IDA) to produce a report titled “Analysis of Differences in Current Patterns of
Claims submitted for Disability Compensation at the Veterans Benefits Administration,” IDA Paper p-
4477, September 2009. Currently, VA does not collect race and ethnicity data for disability
compensation applicants. The IDA group was able to collect Department of Defense (DoD) data on
the race of Veterans and match this data to VA disability compensation recipients. Many of the race
fields, however, were not populated for Veterans who separated from the service before 1990. Based
on IDA findings, minority Veterans claims appeared to be more complex and included multiple
disabling categories, and more minority Veterans also applied for and received Individual Un-
employability ([U).
In the ACMV 2013 Report response to recommendation #5, VBA stated: VBA believes that any
demographic analysis conducted in the future should again be conducted by an expert analytical
organization such as the Institute of Defense Analysis (IDA)({page 17). In 2015 ACMV Report, the VA
Office of Policy and Planning (OPP) stated: OPP does not have the data needed to identify delivery
gaps and potential disparate levels of service for all benefits and utilization programs (page 9).
Title 38 United States Code Sections 317 and 544, specify the required activities of ACMV and the
Center for Minority Veterans (CMV). One of these activities is conducting demographic research on
the needs of Veterans who are minorities and the extent to which programs meet the needs of those
Veterans without regard to any law concerning the collection of information from the public. Another
required activity is conducting an assessment of the needs of Veterans who are minority group
members with respect to compensation, health care, rehabilitation, outreach, and other benefits and
programs administered by the Department.
VA's National Center for Veterans Analysis & Statistics (NCVAS) 2014 Minority Veterans Report,
dated April 2016, indicates that the Veteran population is becoming more diverse and further projects
that minority Veterans will increase from 21 percent in 2014, to 34 percent in 2040 (page 20). This
recommendation aligns with the MyVA Breakthrough Priority #1: To Improve the Veterans
Experience.

VA Response: Concur-in-Principle. VBA concurs-in-principle and agrees that continuous
improvement in services and benefits must be data-driven and evidence-based. Currently, the
Annual Benefits Reports contains gender-specific data but not data specific to race/ethnicity. The
Committee's rationale correctly states that VA does not collect race and ethnicity data for disability
compensation applicants or as part of the claims adjudication process. In response to the ACMV
2015 Annual Report, OPP conducted a review of available data within the Department and various
external resources to determine its suitability for analysis. As a result of that review, OPP is currently
drafting a report on Military History and VA Benefits Utilization Statistics that will include data on
current utilization of VA benefits and services and disability compensation awards by race, ethnicity
and gender. Therefore, VBA does not concur with the recommendation to contract a report to provide
this analysis. VBA believes the OPP report, scheduled for release by the end of FY 2017, will
address the concerns of the committee.
Recommendation #2: That the VHA Office of Health Equity (OHE) be restored to its original
eight Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) staffing level by the end of Calendar Year 2016.
Rationale: During the December 2015, ACMV meeting updates on VHA health equity
accomplishments and initiatives, the ACMV discovered that the staffing of the VHA Office of Health
Equity had been recently reduced from 8 FTEs to 2 FTEs. The Committee was assured by the
Deputy Under Secretary for Health — Organizational Excellence, that the Office of Health Equity
would receive her full support and would be provided adequate resources to fulfill its mission.
However, as June 2016, the OHE staffing level remained at 2 FTEs.
The Commission on Care June 2016, draft report recommendations concluded that VHA leadership
should make health care equity a priority by providing OHE budgetary support in FY 2017 and
beyond to fully staff the office so that it can successfully achieve its mission and goals, to include
providing additional needed funding to support implementation of the Health Equity Action Plan.
Additionally, VHA leadership should ensure OHE reports to senior VHA leadership. Two of the
enabling requirements to support this conclusion included: Restore OHE’s budget to provide the level
of (8 FTE) staffing under which the office operated in March 2013 and; Reinstate OHE within the
office of the USH, to underscore health equity as a priority and to position the office to champion
successfully the advancement of health equity for all Veterans (page 32).
The VA NCVAS 2014 Minority Veterans Report, dated April 2016, indicated that the Veteran
population will decrease from 22.3 million in 2014, to 14.5 million in 2040; and over this time, the
percent of minority Veterans will increase from 21 percent to 34 percent (page 20). In FY 2013, 39
percent of non-prior service active component enlisted female accessions were minorities and 17
percent were Hispanic (page 5).

VA Response: Concur in Principle
VHA OHE has been approved for an additional four FTEs and will work with Human Resources in the
development of position descriptions and recruiting efforts. In November 2015, as part of the VHA
reorganization, the Office of Organizational Excellence (OOE) was established. As part of its
development, four new sub-offices were created and the OHE was moved under its management
umbrella. No new FTE or fiscal resources were provided in support of the reorganization and the
establishment of these sub-program offices. OOE will review the OHE staffing plan again in January
2017, to see if an additional 2 FTEs are available to complete the proposed staffing model. An
additional two vacancies are not available at this time.

851,"Recommendation #3: That the National Cemetery Administration implement a targeted burial
benefits outreach program to eligible spouses, and dependent children of Veterans to
increase their awareness of their eligibility for burial benefits by the end of Fiscal Year 2017.
Rationale: It is apparent that many Veterans and their spouses are unaware of the eligibility for
burial benefits for spouses and certain dependent children. The Center for Minority Veterans
receives numerous inquiries on an ongoing basis and this topic is frequently raised during Advisory
Committee on Minority Veterans town hall meetings, outreach workshops, and other events. The
2010 National Survey of Veterans: Understanding and Knowledge of VA Benefits and Services-
indicated that of those Veterans without burial plans, 29.1 percent did not know the eligibility criteria
(page 180). In that same 2010, report, only 26 percent of surviving spouses reported that they were
very aware or aware of burial and memorial benefits (page 293). This recommended targeted
outreach effort to spouses and dependent children would augment the recent update in burial
eligibility information on the NCA website.

The ACMV hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting at the University of Florida’s LRC Auditorium. The
meeting provided Veterans a forum to share with committee members issues of concern and to
obtain answers to questions related to VA benefits and services. Approximately 60 Veterans and
some family members were in attendance. Local VA officials from the Lake City VA Medical Center,
St. Petersburg Regional Benefit Office and the VA Jacksonville National Cemetery served as panel
members during the meeting. Numerous questions were raised regarding access to medical care,
required documentation when filing a disability claim, billing processes for payment to private
providers, burial benefits and certification process for establishing a Veteran Owned Small Business.
Based upon several questions received from Veterans clarifying burial benefits, the Committee
concluded that many Veterans were not aware of the eligibility criteria for spouses and dependent
children. VA officials to provide appropriate follow up on several issues.

delivery initiatives and benchmarks for the Pacific Rim, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands.
VA Response: VBA 2016 Update. Recommend that this action item be closed based on the
proactive outreach that VBA continues to provide to Veterans residing in rural and remote areas. In
FY 2015, VBA established the Rural Outreach Coordinator (ROC) positions within all of its regional
offices. The ROC provides and/or coordinates outreach support for events hosted in rural
communities. VBA partners with the Office of Rural Health to continuously seek innovative and
creative ways to provide outreach to rural Veterans, such as conducting webinars, and virtual and
twitter town halls. The coordinators are primarily responsible for connecting, educating, and
improving access to VBA benefits for Veterans, Survivors, and eligible beneficiaries who reside in
rural and remote areas. Currently, the ROCs and in some cases MVPCs, partner with external
stakeholders, along with the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and VHA's mobile Vet Centers,
to promote VA benefits and services in rural communities.
The Honolulu Regional Office (RO) serves the Veterans, Survivors, and eligible beneficiaries of
Hawaii and the Western Pacific US Territories. The RO has out-based offices in Hilo, HI, Kahului, HI,
and Hagatna, Guam. The catchment area covers many small island populations dispersed
throughout an enormous geographic area of approximately 4.6 million square miles of the Pacific
Ocean, and includes the State of Hawaii, US Territories of Guam and American Samoa, as well as
the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands (Saipan, Tinian, and Rota).
VBA continues to use outreach coordinators from the RO to provide information about VA benefits
and services to Veterans and Service members who reside in Hawaii. The RO schedules visits to the
islands of Kauai, Maui, Molokai, and Lanai regularly. Accordingly, the RO benefit counselors travel to
Kauai every two months, Maui monthly, and Lani and Molokai quarterly. Outreach dates to these
locations are also posted on the ROs website and announced in the communities via flyers and
media spots. In addition, RO employees representing each business line (Compensation, Vocational
Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E), and Loan Guaranty) travel to American Samoa to conduct
VA benefits workshops and provide benefits counseling to Veterans, Survivors, and family members
residing on the island. Due to the high expense of traveling, lack of funding, and the logistical
difficulty in scheduling travel , the RO has conducted limited travel to the Federated States of
Micronesia (Island of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae) and the Commonwealth of the Marianas
Islands (Saipan, Rota, and Tinian).
Similarly, the San Juan RO provides the delivery of VA benefits and services to the island of Puerto
Rico and St. Thomas and St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Outreach coordinators from the RO travel to the
islands monthly to provide benefits assistance and claims clinics.
Finally, RO benefit counselors provide pamphlets, factsheets, and other resources to Veterans
residing in rural and remote areas to educate, inform, and empower them.

VA Response: VHA 2016 Update. The VA Pacific Islands Health Care System has been privileged
to provide medical care services to Guam’s Veterans since the early 1980s, to American Samoa
since 2007 and to Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) since 2010. Guam
Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) has 40 staff members, including 9 providers. American
Samoa CBOC has 23 staff members, including 3 providers. CNMI Outreach Clinic has 1.2 staff,
including a provider who cares for CNMI Veterans one day a week. The Guam CBOC provides
primary care, mental health, and women’s health care. Visiting VA providers, telehealth, and home
based primary care services allow for specialty care such as Endocrinology, Gastroenterology,
Podiatry, and Polytrauma/Traumatic Brain Injury services. VA also has agreements with the Naval
Hospital for emergency care, acute inpatient care, and some specialty services. Veterans requiring
off island referrals are assisted by VA Beneficiary Travel, if eligible, to help defray costs. American
Samoa (AMS) CBOC and CNMI Outreach Clinic offer basically the same services, as do the Guam
CBOC, but with more emphasis on video television (VTEL), and less home based primary care. FY
2015 VA travel support provided for these Veterans is depicted below:

In addition to VA staff, the Guam CBOC shares a pharmacist with the Naval Hospital, for education
and consultation both with Veterans and staff, along with a Diabetes Nurse Educator and a Nurse
Care Coordinator.
VA staff support our Guam Homeless Veteran Program with outreach, case management, and
referral services. The Housing and Urban Development - VA Supportive Housing program provides
vouchers to assist eligible Guam Veterans. Efforts are also underway to establish a five-bed
emergency housing program as part of the VA Pacific islands HCS Homeless Veterans Transition
Program and a Veterans’ Treatment Court on Guam.
VA officials have established relationships with multiple University of Guam Department Heads. This
will allow University of Guam students in the programs of nursing, social work and public health
disciplines such as pre-physical therapy, nutrition and health promotion, to gain valued experience at
the Guam CBOC, as well as in homecare and outreach settings.
We continually strive to provide Veteran-centered care by a well-coordinated and dynamic
multidisciplinary team approach and we encourage Veterans to be an active participant in their
healthcare via computer by visiting MyHealtheVet.com.
We have come a long way from our Insular VA clinic inception and all of the VA staff are honored to
serve these Veteran communities.

Per the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act (VACAA) of 2014 and subsequent
amendments, Veterans are eligible to participate in the Veterans Choice Program if they are enrolled

869,"complexity of standard, and reside more than 20 miles from such a VA medical facility, among other
eligibility criteria. This criterion applies to Veterans residing in Guam, American Samoa,
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. VHA is continually
working to address confusion about eligibility for use of VACAA in these locations.
Unlike the above-listed territories, Puerto Rico has a VA medical facility that provides hospital care,
emergency services, and surgical care having a surgical complexity of standard. Thus Puerto Rico
Veterans who reside within 40 miles of the loca! VA medical facility and do not have to take a boat,
plane or ferry to reach the facility are only eligible to use VACAA if VA is unable to provide an
appointment within the wait-time goals of VHA or within a period that is less than this if such care or
services are deemed clinically necessary, unless they face an unusual or excessive burden in
traveling to that facility. Recent amendments to VACAA and its implementing regulations provide VA
greater flexibility to determine eligibility based on burden in travel.

VHA Action Plan — Recommendation #3: VA develops an insular catchment area plan that includes

enhanced service delivery initiatives and benchmarks for the Pacific Rim, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin

Islands.

VA Response: VBA 2016 Update
VA is continuing to revise and update all outstanding regulations in the VA Schedule for Rating
Disabilities (VASRD). VBA has drafted, or is in the process of drafting, 14 proposed rulemaking
packages that will cover the 15 body systems in the VASRD. We plan to have all proposed
regulations published by the end of FY 2017.
VA intends to publish final rulemakings for all VASRD body systems by the end of FY 2018.
VBA will place each VASRD body system into a 5-year cycle of staggered reviews, as illustrated in
Table 3. This strategy is based on recommendations from a 2007, report prepared by the Institute of
Medicine (IOM). !OM proposed a series of corrections to the existing schedule and guidance
designed to improve Veterans benefits. The tables below provide the current status and the
estimated major milestone dates for each of the 15 VASRD body systems.
Table 1, VASRD Concurrence Phase, describes those body systems that have concluded the
working group and development phases. It provides their estimated milestone dates for concurrence.

888,"Letter from the Advisory Committee Chair
Dear Secretary Shulkin:
| | am honored to serve as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans
{(ACMV). The enclosed 2017 Annual Report includes recommendations which reflect
key issues identified by the Committee during its visits to the Department of Veterans
Affairs cites in the Jacksonville, FL and site visit conducted in the Albuquerque, NM
areas. While visiting these areas we also conducted Town Hall meetings to gather
issues and recommendations from our veterans at these sites.
The Advisory Committee applauds you for the tremendous progress you have made in
improving services provided to our veterans in a very short period of time. Under your
leadership, mental health care is currently available to veterans with other-than-
honorable discharges and in distress, authorized veterans with other than Honorable
discharges to be eligible for VA benefits based on the initial period, and you succeeded
in working with Congress to pass legislation that provides necessary funding to maintain |
and expand the Choice Program. In response to the projected growth of minority
veterans, you also approved funding for an additional Program Analyst position for the
Center for Minority Veterans. All of these changes are very significant in serving those
who have served our great nation.
Our Committee Report reflects ongoing concerns of minority veterans which we heard |
as we traveled to different VA facilities and sites. An ongoing major concern of the
committee is the VA’s inconsistency in collecting race and ethnicity data because it
impedes VA's ability to adequately identify and address repetitive issues and concerns
of minority veterans and ethnicity data by VBA, VHA and NCA. Additionally, this data is
critically needed to identify health disparities and to ensure that minority veterans are
receiving quality care and services throughout the VA system. The 2016 Commission
on Care report and previous advisory committee recommendations provide sound
rationales for gathering and analyzing comprehensive race and ethnicity data as well as
demographic data. The consistent tracking of such data will ensure the Department's
commitment to provide equitable and impartial services and programs fo all veterans, _
We, as the ACMV, therefore strongly request your support in requiring that the Veterans
Benefit Administration, Veterans Health Administration and National Cemetery
Administration begin the formai collection of race and ethnicity data as a part of VA’s
modernization plans.
The Committee appreciates the VBA’s response to expand its capabilities to collect
} demographic/ethnicity data to determine the best way for VBA to fully implement an
equitable system in its many programs provided specifically around compensation for
service-connected disabilities. |
",1,0,0,0
889,"The Committee recognizes VHA’s Women’s Health for having already produced on-
going materials, posters, and brochures in Spanish and the Veterans Experience Office
for adding a self-reported race question to the Outpatient Survey to increase collecting
minority veterans sample size for outpatient surveys.
The Committee is disappointed that the staffing level in the VHA Office of Health Equity
(OHE) has once again been delayed thus raising the issue if there is a real commitment
and where does health equity lie in VA’s list of priorities. The Commission on Care in its
final report also addressed this issue in recommendation #5. Another disappointment is
the lack of action taken to implement interventions to address identified health
disparities identified in the 2007 report entitled Evidence Brief: Update on Prevalence of
and Interventions to reduce Racial and Ethnic Disparities with the VA to demonstrate
progress made. The Committee questions the value of conducting research and not
following through on implementing effective strategies that would improve the quality of
care provided to minority veterans.
The Committee recommends you authorize the Center for Minority Veterans to
collaborate with VA partners to organize and host a National Minority Veterans Summit
in 2018. In the history of VA, no such event has ever been held and seems extremely
important given the changing demographics of the veteran population. A National
Minority Veterans Summit would provide the opportunity for minority veterans to hear
from the VA leadership while providing them a platform to vocalize what is important to
them in serving their unique needs.
The Committee is strongly encouraged by the Secretary's leadership to ensure the VA's
ongoing progress to enhance access to VA services for all Veterans! |
In closing, ACMV respectfully requests that future briefings from VA entities include
specific racial and ethnicity data and recommendations at the next ACMV meeting
tentatively scheduled for October 2017 in Washington, DC. | extend the Committee's
special thanks to the staff of the Center for Minority Veterans for their professionalism
and continued outstanding support to the ACMV.
On behalf of the Committee, | express my sincere appreciation for allowing us the
privilege to serve the VA and out Nations Minority Veterans.
Respecttully,
: ere M. Rivas fi?

890,"Part I. Executive Summary
The 2017 Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the
Committee's observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the effectiveness of the
Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans. The
report also provides Departmental responses and action pians to address the 2017 ACMV Annual
Report recommendations, and a summary of the progress made on action plans from the 2012 and
2016 ACMV Reports.
The ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in accordance
with Public Law 103-446, and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans dated
March 7, 2016. The ACMV met on December 6-8, 2016, at VA Central Office (VACO) and conducted
a site visit in the Albuquerque, New Mexico area from April 11-13, 2017. The meeting at VACO
included briefings from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and select staff offices.
Ex-Officio members from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department
of Commerce (DOC) provided briefings on their respective missions and services provided to minority
Veterans at the VACO meeting. During the Albuquerque site visit, the ACMV received briefings and
facility tours at the New Mexico VA Health Care Center, Albuquerque Regional Benefit Office, and
Santa Fe National Cemetery. On the afternoon of April 12, 2017, the ACMV and representatives from
the New Mexico Health Care Center, Albuquerque Regional Benefit Office, and Santa Fe National
Cemetery responded to questions from minority Veterans and proviced updates on current VA
initiatives during a town hall meeting conducted at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center (IPCC) in
Albuquerque.
The ACMY reviewed information received during meetings with VA officials, through document
reviews, and from direct communications with minority Veterans. The Committee strongly believes
that if implemented, the four 2017 recommendations will significantly enhance VA's ability to :
strategically address the needs of minority Veterans as the Veterans population become more |
diverse. These recommendations and rationales address the following issues: |
e Collecting and analyzing race and ethnicity data across ali business lines to identify, monitor, |
and address potential disparities that effect minority Veterans by the start of fiscal year (FY) |
2018. !
|
e Providing the Office of Health Equity (OHE) necessary personnel resources by the end of FY
2017 to facilitate implementation of the VA Health Equity Action Plan.
e Publishing an update to the 2015 Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) |
Report entitled Evidence Brief: Update on Prevalence of and Interventions to Reduce Racial
and Ethnic Disparities within the VA to demonstrate the progress made to address identified
issues and disparities that impact minority Veterans by the end of FY 2018.
e Ensuring that the Spanish language versions of the instructions for applications for VA benefits
and services are readily available, especially in areas of the country with high Latino/Hispanic
populations, to assist Veterans and their family members secure VA benefits and services.

Recommendation #1: That the Department of Veterans Affairs collect and analyze race and
ethnicity data across all business lines to identify, monitor, and address potential disparities
that effect minority Veterans by the start of FY 2018.
Rationale: The requirement to gather data for the purpose of planning and evaluating VA programs
is found in 38 U.S.C., Part !, Chapter 5, Subchapter Il, Section 527(b). In carrying out this section,
the Secretary shall collect, collate, and analyze on a continuing basis full statistical data regarding
participation (including the duration thereof), provision of services, categories of beneficiaries
planning and construction of facilities, acquisition of real property, proposed excessing of land,
accretion and attrition of personnel, and categorized expenditures attributable thereto.

A 2007 VA Office of General Counsel opinion memorandum on the subject of gathering demographic
data stated, 38 U.S.C., Part I, Chapter 5, Subchapter III, Section 544(c)(1)(A)(B)(C) requires the
annuai report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans include an assessment of the needs of
Veterans who are minority group members with respect to compensation, health care, rehabilitation,
outreach, and other benefits and programs administered by the Department. In order for the |
Committee to capture and report this information, VHA, VBA, and NCA must collect this information.
In addition, one of the primary purposes of the Center for Minority Veterans is to conduct and sponsor
appropriate social and demographic research on the needs of Veterans who are minorities and the
extent to which program authorized under this title meet the needs of those Veterans, without regard
to any law concerning the collection of information from the public. 38 U.S.C., Part |, Chapter 3,
Section 317(d)(5). The Center for Minority Veterans’ ability to “conduct and sponsor’ research as
needed to determine minority Veterans’ needs and the efficacy of the VA programs in meeting them,
also require the participation of the three program administrations.

Guidance under 38 U.S.C. requires the Center for Minority Veterans and Center for Women Veterans
to conduct demographic utilization reviews. Currently, the Department has focused most of its efforts
to gender specific data reviews. There exists a disparity in the manner in which VA collects
demographic data. Race and ethnicity data along with gender identification is requested on the VA
Form 1010EZ - Application for Health Benefits. However, the following VA forms utilized to apply for
VA benefits and services only ask for voluntary gender identification: VA Form 21-526EZ (Feb 2016)
- Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits; VA Form 21-534EZ
(Jun 2014) - Application for DIC, Death Pension, and/or Accrued Benefits; VA Form 21-2680 (May
2015) - Examination for Housebound Siatus of Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance and;
VA Form 40-10007 (Nov 2016) - Application for Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial in a
VA National Cemetery. The Department of Veterans Affairs Annua! Benefits Report (Compensation
and Pension sections) contains gender reviews of benefits utilization but does not have a similar
race/ethnicity review. Race/Ethnicity and gender reviews of utilization are reflected only for the Home
Loan Guaranty section.

In 2017, the VA National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics published the Minority Veterans
Report - Military Service History and VA Benefits Utilization Statistics. This report chronicles the
history of racial and ethnic minorities in the military as Veterans and profiles characteristics of minority
Veterans in 2014. This report primarily depicts minority Veterans’ utilization of VA benefits and
services in the aggregate. However, a further review by specific race and ethnicity is required to
position the Department to meet the future needs of a more diverse population.

In the 2016 Commission on Care Report, Recommendation #5 - Health Care Equity, the Commission
recommended — VHA increase the availability, quality, use of race, ethnicity, and language data to
improve the health of minority Veterans and other vulnerable Veteran populations with strong
surveillance systems that monitor trends in health status, patient satisfaction, and quality measures.

VAOIG Report 15-04673-333, VHA Review of the Implementation of the Veterans Choice Program
included a review of Choice Utilization by Top Medical Services Needed, but did not include a
demographic (race/ethnicity of gender) review of patients involved in the appointment process. Two
of the eight facilities (VA Greater Los Angeles and South Texas Veterans Health Care System)
reviewed in the report were in high minority Veteran population areas. The OIG report noted that the
primary barriers encountered by Veterans utilizing the Choice Program were cumbersome |
authorization processes, authorization and scheduling procedures, and inadequate provider |
networks. It would also seem appropriate to determine if a demographic comparison of the eight
facilities reviewed would have identified disparities. During the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans (ACMV) April 2017 site visit to Albuquerque, New Mexico, the Committee was provided an
update on the local progress made with the Veterans’ Choice Program. It was noted during the
briefing that Hispanics/Latino Veterans were not part of the racial demographic review of utilization of |
the program in New Mexico. The Committee realizes that Hispanic/Latino is not categorized as a
race; rather itis specified as ethnicity. However, due to the past history of individuals from this ethnic |
group being designated to the “White” racial group (including two committee members); it is highly |
recommended that VA include ethnicity in demographic reviews of health programs utilization.
Additionally, the Hispanic Veteran population is projected to increase from 1,500,000 in 2014 to
2,055,000 by 2043.

The MITRE Corporation created a Blue Ribbon Panel composed of heaith experts and published
Independent Assessment of the Health Care Delivery Systems and Management Processes of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, September 2015. One of the report’s key findings was that VA needs
a patient-centered demand model that forecasts resources needed by geographic location to improve
access and make informed resourcing decisions. This tool needs to be able to forecast demand at
the local facility level and fine-tune its estimates of required resources. A comprehensive
demographic review of current and projected utilization of VA benefits and services would be part of a
patient-centered approach recommended by the MITRE Corporation, pages xiv-xv.

VBA Response: Concur in Principle
VBA will reach out to SSA to determine what type of demographic/ethic information is available to its
agency and whether VBA could use this additiona! data for analysis of its own benefit programs. VBA
will also work with the National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics (NCVAS) to determine
whether the 2017 Minority Veterans Report data on beneficiaries can be categorized by specific

Veterans Experience Office (VEO) Response: Concur in Principle
Veterans Experience Office collects self-reported race data via service-level (transactional) web- |
based surveys. Because this data is voluntarily self-reported by Veterans (or other survey :
participants), VEO’s ability to identify potential disparities that effect minority Veterans (or other |
survey participants) is contingent on their willingness to provide this voluntary race information. To :
the extent that VEO receives such voluntary, self-reported race data, VEO will analyze this data and |
share with the Center for Minority Veterans. With respect to “address[ing]” potential disparities
identified, such action appears to fall outside the scope of VEO’s distinct mission. Instead, such
action would most appropriately be owned by the specific Administration/line of business providing
the service or care.
VEO has added a self-reported race question to the Outpatient Survey, which has been launched.
VEO will add this question to additional service-level (transactional) web-based surveys as they are

Recommendation #2: That the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health
Administration, follows through on its commitment to provide the VHA Office of Health Equity
(OHE) necessary personnel resources by the end of FY 2017, to facilitate implementation of
the VA Health Equity Action Plan.
Rationale: In December 2016, VHA Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Organizational
Excellence assured the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans that the Office of Health Equity was
approved for two additional full time employees in July 2016 and that the Office of Health Equity’s
mission had her full support. As of June 2017, no additional staffing resources have been provided.
At the time of the drafting of this 2017 recommendation, VHA was completing the classification
process to update the position descriptions prior to starting the recruitment action for these positions.
However, such actions cannot be initiated since a waiver to allow recruitment under the current hiring
process has not been approved.
In the recent 2016 Commission on Care Report, Recommendation #5 - Health Care Equity, the
Commission recommended: VHA work to eliminate health disparities by establishing health care
equity as a strategic priority; VHA provide the Office of Health Equity adequate resources, level of
authority to successfully build cultural military competence among all VHA Care Systems providers
and employees and; VHA ensures that the Health Equity Action Pian (HEAP) is fully implemented
with adequate staffing, resources and support. The lack of additional staff in the Office of Health
Equity has hampered the implementation of the HEAP. :

VA anticipates a smaller, but more diverse Veteran population. VA projects a future overall Veteran
population in 2043 being 14.5 million, with minority Veterans being 5.2 million, and women Veterans :
being 2.3 million. Minority Veterans currently comprise approximately 33 percent of the women |
Veteran population. In 2014, 45.6 percent (2 million) minority Veterans were enrolled in VHA with
approximately 1.3 million using the system and 16.9 percent of those users being service-connected. |

Recommendation #3: That the Department of Veterans Affairs publish an update to the 2015
Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Report entitled Evidence Brief: Update
on Prevalence of and Interventions to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Disparities within the VA to |
demonstrate the progress made to address the identified issues that impact minority Veterans |
by the end of FY 2018. :
|
Rationale: Recent VA research projects have identified differences in clinical outcomes between |
minority and non-minority Veterans in the areas of pain management, hypertension, and end of life
care. The projected increasing diversity of the Veterans by 2043 will result in the minority Veteran

902,"population being approximately 35.7 percent (5.2 million) of the overall Veteran population of
approximately 14.5 million, even as the total Veteran population decreases from its 2014 level of
approximately 22 million. As VA positions itself to enhance patient-centered care and build trust for
an increasingly diverse Veteran population, it is important for clinical disparities to be identified and
addressed in a proactive manner.
The cited HSR&D report (p.8) identified evidence gaps and stated: “More research is needed to
establish the presence or absence of a mortality or morbidity disparity for African Americans with
diabetes, stroke, or venous thromboembolism (VTE), American Indians or Alaskan Natives following
major non-cardiac surgery, and African American and American indian or Alaskan Native pregnant
women with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The few interventions that have improved
racial/ethnic disparities within the VA have focused only on African Americans and have covered a
narrow scope of clinical areas. More research is needed to examine disparities in Hispanic, Asian,
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian and Alaska Native groups, and in
other priority conditions including HIV, hepatitis C, mental illness, spinal cord injury, substance use
disorders, polytrauma, and blast-related injuries. Ideally, future research should be done in the form
of prospective studies that address multiple minority groups and supplement VHA data with Medicare
data.”

Recently, VHA researchers found significant disparities for hypertension persisting in the VA
healthcare system for particular racial/ethnic minority patients as compared to white patients in VA's
patient-centered care medical homes.

Recommendation #4: That the Department of Veterans Affairs ensure that the Spanish
language versions of the instructions for applications for VA benefits and services are readily
available, especially in areas of the country with high Latino/Hispanic populations, to assist
Veterans and their family members seeking VA benefits and services.
Rationale: Hispanic/Latino Veterans are expected to increase from approximately 1,500,000 in 2014
to approximately 2,055,000 in 2043 (Minority Veterans Report 2017, Figure 1, page 23). Various
research studies have shown that language proficiency can be a barrier for Hispanic/Latino patients
and family members.

The Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) has been asked by Hispanic/Latino Veterans
to ensure that VA has outreach materials in Spanish to assist family members as they determine their
eligibility for benefits and services or attempt to encourage their Veteran family members to apply for
VA services. A review of the VA website in May 2017 revealed the existence of fact sheets,
brochures, eBenefits publications, and an electronic version of the VA benefits book. Some of the
fact sheets and brochures are in Spanish. However, the electronic version of the VA benefits book is
only in English. The instructions on the new (Nov 2016) VA Form 40-10007 - Application For Pre-
Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial In A VA National Cemetery is only in English which is not
helpful to Veteran family member for which English is a second language. VA employees have asked
the Center for Minority Veterans and Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans for information on the
location of Spanish language outreach materials. Therefore, it would be helpful for all VA outreach
personnel in high Hispanic/Latino areas to inform other VA personnel and Veteran family members of
the location/availability of the Spanish language materials and that VA facilities in these areas have
these translated documents readily available.

VA Responses:
VBA Response: Concur
Recently, within the last 60 days, the Benefits Assistance Service (BAS) conducted U.S. Census data
research related to areas of the country with high Hispanic populations. The research showed the VA
regional offices (VARQs) with jurisdiction over those “high” Hispanic population areas were the Waco
and Houston ROs, the San Diego, Oakland, and San Francisco ROs, the New York RO, the Chicago
RO, and the Phoenix RO. (Please note the San Juan VARO website is already translated into
Spanish http://www.benefits.va.gov/sanjuansp/index-sp.asp). In addition to researching Census data,
BAS also reviewed the Annual Benefits Report (ABR) to research and consider benefit recipients’
demographic information. Now that this research is complete, the next step is to submit the data from
the VAROs within the high Hispanic population areas for translations. BAS will be turning over the
web content of these VAROs to translators within the next 30 days as part of its Translation Services
contract. It is expected that the translated web pages will be built by the end of this fiscal year.
Additionally, BAS is in the planning stages of translating the Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
Participant User Guides. The TAP program is currently undergoing a redesign, which will be
completed in 2018. Upon completion of this redesign, the Participant User Guide will also be
translated. Finally, as indicated below, the VA Federal Benefits for Veterans, Dependents and
Survivors publication is prepared each year and has not been translated into Spanish since 2013.
The following link directs you to the latest Spanish language version:

The ACMV hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting at the Indian Pueblo Cultural Center (IPCC). The
meeting provided Veterans a forum to share with committee members issues of concern and to
obtain answers to questions related to VA benefits and services. Approximately 16 Veterans and
some family members were in attendance. Local VA officials from the New Mexico Health Care
Center (HCS), Albuquerque Regional Benefit Office and the Santa Fe National Cemetery served as
panel members during the meeting. Numerous questions were raised regarding the backlog of :
claims, how to qualify for clothing allowances, Native American Cemetery Grant Program, Native
American Direct Home Loan Program, and Tribal HUD-VASH Program. Tribal Veterans
recommended that VA staff need to be culturally sensitive when dealing with different tribes. VA
needs to “physically” go out to the highly rural areas. Veterans also inquired about the VSO
Legislation — a change in 38 CFR 14.628 which allows eligible tribal Veteran Service Organizations to
become accredited by VA. VA officials to provide appropriate follow up on several issues.

System (HCS), and Santa Fe National Cemetery
Sammie Quillin, Director, Albuquerque Regional Benefit Office:
e Referenced substance abuse — it is on the rise — turning more to educating the Veterans on
the resources available that VA offers.
e VBA does not have a marketing budget.
e It is a challenge in getting the word out to the Veterans — getting the Veterans to attend town
hall meetings. Even if the word gets out there — still have an issue in getting Veterans to
attend. Need to find out where the “disconnect” is.
e Will definitely look at the VSO’s outside of the Regional Office — the RO Director has been on
board for 3 months but will definitely look at this — will do better coordination.
e Referenced the VRE Program — he will check to see if Albuquerque is the only area that has a
VRE Program. ,
e 71 percent of employees in the Regional Office are Veterans.
Andrew Welch, Director, New Mexico Health Care System (HCS):
e Referenced the outreach efforts — the Minority Veterans Programs Coordinators (MVPC) will
conduct more aggressive outreach — expand their outreach efforts.
e Had aconversation with VBA and NCA about coordinating with their MVPCs in conducting
their outreach efforts.
e Now that the Hiring Freeze has been lifted, VHA will be abie to target more interns from
Colleges, etc.
e Planning on backing out of the Residential Program and turn more to outreaching to the
Veterans with substance abuse ~— especially physically going out to the Veterans.
e Also looking at turning to genetic testing to assist in substance abuse. :
« Will need to focus on communication processes to get the word out to Veterans on available :
services.
o Do have a lot of Native American Veterans in their area and a lot of Native American
Veterans prefer to go to their Indian Heaith Centers for care. |
o Will do a more aggressive outreach effort — provide research efforts to target the needs
of Native Americans.
e Do not have the budget for advertising. Marketing efforts is very low — reluctant to spend a lot
of money on marketing, money that can be spent on taking care of the Veterans.
e Veterans enrolled in the VA has a low suicide rate — Veterans not enrolled/unknown to the VA
have a high suicide rate. |
|
Jared Howard, Assistant Director, Santa Fe National Cemetery:
e Just attended the Cemetery Directors Conference.
e Do coordinate outreach efforts with VBA & VHA but not necessarily with the MVPC — do rotate
their staff in their outreach efforts. |

Dear Secretary Wilkie: |
| am grateful to serve as the Chairman of the Advisory Committee for Minority Veterans ;
(ACMV). The enclosed 2018 Annual Report includes recommendations which reflect key issues i
identified by the Committee through briefings received at VA Central Office in December 2017
and a site visit to the Department of Veterans Affairs facilities in the St Louis, MO area in April oo
2018. While visiting the VA facilities in St Louis, MO we received feedback from the town hall !
meeting conducted at Harris Stowe University to gather issues and recommendations from our |
Veterans. ,
The committee members’ background has bean a tremendous asset to ensure the Committee |
provides you and the Congress the most enduring recommendations to ensure our minority
Veterans received fair and equitable care and services from the Department of Veterans Affairs, |
| served In the U.S. Army for over 24 years and retired as a Command Sergeant Major (CSM)
having served as a CSM at the Brigade-level. Other committee members are also Veterans of :
Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The overall experience of our :
members has contributed significantly and have only provided recommendations needing
change within the Department of the Veterans Affairs. Some of our members have gone :
, beyond the scope of our Committee’s tine and have personally been involved in positively !
effecting Veterans’ services and benefits in disaster areas and homeless programs, Our 2
members aré members who have their boots on the ground. |
One of our recommendations is to address the concerns of honorably discharged deported
minority Veterans. A 31-member Congressional Hispanic Caucus report said there are about :
3000 cases of Veterans deported to countries around the world, though the U.S. Government :
does not track them. Our recommendation is to facilitate the travel and compensation and
pension examinations for our deported honorably discharged Veterans. |
The recently signed into law Mission Act is favorably received by this Committee. Veteran :
Service Organizations, which we interact with in our role as Committee members, are in
allanment and support the new law. VSO's championed the expansion of the VA Caragiver ,
Program which will now extend benefits to Veterans of afl eras. Of course, extending the
Choice Pragram through May 2019 while the department Implements the new consolidated :
community care program is a major accomplishment which will benefit many minority Veterans,
The Committee commends the VHA for having selected a Director for the Office of Health :
Equity and we are encouraged by their commitment to fully staff that operation. We look
forward to VHA fully staffing this office by the end of FY 2019. The Committee values this office |
_ to conduct research and following through on implementing effective strategies that will improve :
the quality of care provided to minority Veterans. :
The Advisory Committee applauds the Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office for the
tremendous progress you have made in improving services provided to our minority Veterans in
a vary short period. Recantly, the NCA and VHA have agreed with one of our previously
submitted major recommendations to provide race and ethnicity data which is mandated by the :
",1,0,0,0
930,"OGC opinion of March 2007, We ask for your support to be explicit with the VBA leadership to |
include race and ethnicity date in their annual reports, specifically any reports regarding the :

- utilization of benefits and the determination/denia! of benefits and more specifically around
compensation for service-connected disabilities. Once the VBA data Is provided, we pledge to
provide whatever caveats or disclaimers are necessary to ensure the information Is interpreted
and acted upon in its proper context. The consistent tracking of such data will ensure the
Department's commitment to provide equitable and impartial services and programs to all
Veterans. |
The Committee commends the NCA for having already made changes to their VA Form 40- :
1330 (Claim for Standard Government Headstone and Marker), The VA Form added Biock #5
for Race or Ethnicity Data. This will ensure NCA will be able to include this information in their
annual reports. |
The Committee thanks the VA for authorizing the Center for Minority Veterans to collaborate
with VA partners to organize and host a National Minority Veterans Summit in 2079. In the 3
history of VA, no such event has ever been held and seems extremely important given the :
changing demographics of the Veteran population. A National Minority Veterans Summit would
provide the opportunity for minority Veterans to hear from the VA leadership while providing
thern a platform to vocalize what is important to them in serving their unique needs. |
Of note, are the VA statistics which predict the minority Veterans’ population io increase from |
23.2 percent of the total Veteran population in 2017 to 32.8 percent in 2037. Hispanic Veterans
will increase fram 7.4 percent in 2017 to 11.2 parcent in 2037. The Committee will remain :
vigilant in its duties to ensure the VA provides our minority Veterans the health care and |
benefits which minority Veterans are entitled. |

| Overall, the Committee is strongly encouraged by the Department's leadership to ensure the :
VA's ongoing progress to enhance access to VA services for all Veterans! | would also like to
thank the VA leadership for the positive experience of meeting with all the Advisory Committee :
Chairs to encourage oross-collaboration. This committee remains hopeful this process and |
program ls continued. :
In closing, ACMV respectfully requests that future briefings from VA entities include specific
race and ethnicity data and recommendations at the next ACMV meeting tentatively scheduled |
for December 2018 in Washington, DC.. | extend the Committee's special thanks to the expert
staff of the Center for Minority Veterans for thelr professionalism and continued outstanding
supportto the ACMV, >
On behalf of the Cornmittes, | express my sincere appreciation for allowing us the privilege to |
serve the VA and our Nation’s Minority Veterans. : |
, Respectfully,

The 2018 Annual Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the
Committee's observations, recommendations, and rationales that address the effectiveness of the |
Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans. The
report also provides Departmental responses and action plans to address the 2018 ACMV Annual |
Report recommendations and a summary of the progress made on action plans from the 2012, 2016, 2
and 2017 ACMV Reports.
ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings this year in accordance with |
Public Law 103-446 and the VA Charter on the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans dated :
March 7, 2018. ACMV met on December 12-14, 2017, at VA Central Office (VACO) and conducted a |
sife visit in St. Louis, Missouri, from April 17-19, 2018. The meeting at VACO included briefings from
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), |
National Cemetery Administration (NCA), and select VA Staff Offices. Ex-Officio members from the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Labor (DOL) provided briefings :
on their respective missions and services provided to minority Veterans at the VACO meeting. :
During the St. Louis site visit, ACMV received briefings and facility tours at the St. Louis Health Care
System-John Cochran Division, St. Louis Regional Benefit Office, and Jefferson Barracks National :
Cemetery. On the afternoon of April 18, 2018, ACMV and representatives from the St. Louis Health
Care System, St. Louis Regional Benefit Office, and Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery , :
responded to questions from minority Veterans and provided updates on current VA initiatives during
a town hail meeting conducted at the William L. Clay, Sr. Early Childhood Center, Harris-Stowe State :
University (HSSU) in St. Louis. |
ACMV reviewed information received during meetings with VA officials, through document reviews, |
and from direct communications with minority Veterans. The Committee strongly believes that if :
implemented, the four 2018 recommendations wiil significantly enhance VA's ability to strategically 2
address the needs of minority Veterans as the Veterans population become more diverse. These a
recommendations and rationales address the following issues: 2
e Develop comprehensive plans to provide access to health care services and benefits for all |
honorably-discharged, deported Veterans by June 2019. |

e Require VBA to collaborate with the National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics to
publish disability award reports bi-annually to identify and address potential racial/ethnic award 2
disparities by the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2019.

e VHA follows through on its commitment to provide the VHA Office of Health Equity (OHE)
necessary personnel resources by the end of FY 2019 to facilitate implementation of the VA 3

Health Equity Action Plan. |

e VBA develops a comprehensive communication plan to encourage minority Veteran :

| participation in the Rapid Appeals Management Process {RAMP) by 2nd Quarter, FY 2019.

933,"Part III. ACMV 2018 Recommendations, Rationales, and VA Responses
Recommendation #1: That the Department of Veterans Affairs proactively develop :
comprehensive plans to provide access to health care services and benefits for all honorably ;
discharged deported Veterans by June 2019.
Rationale: Based upon recent revisions to existing immigration laws, military Veterans who are not ,
U.S. citizens can be deported if they are convicted of committing crimes. When these Veterans are }
deported, one of the biggest challenges they face is access to basic health care for various medical :
conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 31-member Congressional Hispanic |
Caucus estimates there are about 3,000 cases of Veterans deported to countries around the world, ,
though the U.S. Government does not track them. In response to the increasing number of deported
Veterans and concerns expressed by members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, VA |
established an exam location in Tijuana, Mexico. Veterans are now able to obtain general medical !
exams, including hearing and mental health exams. Ultimately, the exam results will assist with !
receiving disability ratings for service-connected conditions. There have been recent reports that |
Veterans are being deported who have no criminal records. Assuming this trend will continue, VA will
need to make this issue a priority in terms of serving the growing needs of deported Veterans. :
Although VA does not track the number of deported Veterans at this time, it is prudent that such data :
are tracked so that the issue is properly measured/scoped and appropriate services are readily |
available as deportations continue. !
VA Responses: , |
VBA Response: Concur in Principle
VA currently provides benefits and services to honorably discharged Veterans, including Veterans :
who have been deported. Eligible Veterans may submit claims for VA benefits under applicable laws :
governing the type of benefit sought. VA provides Veterans with assistance needed in gathering the :
supporting evidence to complete a claim submission, including a disability medical examination, if in |
order. Although VA did not set up a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico, as indicated in the rationale for this
recommendation, VA contracts with Veterans Evaluation Services to perform disability compensation
examinations in several international locations, including Mexico. Veterans are not charged for the
VA disability examination that is ordered as part of the claim for benefits. |
As VA offers the same benefits and services to all honorably discharged Veterans domestic and |
abroad, VA does not need to develop a comprehensive plan for access to benefits specific to |
deported Veterans.
VHA Response: Non-Concur :
Due to limitations in the current authority for VA to provide payment for health care services for
certain eligible Veterans in foreign countries, VA is unable to provide a more comprehensive health |
care benefit. |
All honorably discharged deported Veterans living abroad have access to health care services for |
their service connected disabilities through the Foreign Medical Program (38 United States Code 2
(U.S.C) 1724). Based on the law, eligibility requirements for medical services are different for 3
Veterans outside the United States than within the United States. The Foreign Medical Program 2

8
",0,0,0,0
934,"assumes payment responsibility for U.S. Veterans only for a VA-rated service-connected disability, or |
any disability associated with and heid to be aggravating a VA-rated, service-connected disability (38 :
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 17.35). In order to provide a more comprehensive benefit, VA 2
requires legislative change to 38 U.S.C. 1724 to allow for the provision of health care for Veterans’
nonservice-connected canditions. |

Recommendation #2: That the Department of Veterans Affairs require the Veterans Benefits
Administration to collaborate with the National Center for Veterans Analysis and Statistics to
publish disability award reports bi-annuailly to identify and address potential racial/ethnic |
award disparities by the end of FY 2019. :
_ Rationale: During the December 2016 ACMV meeting, former Secretary David Shulkin committed to
address this longstanding recommendation due to its importance to the Committee in fulfilling its 2
Congressionally mandated responsibilities. The issue was briefed to the Senior Leadership team at
morning report meetings. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Data Governance and Analytics, :
confirmed that they now had the capability through data matching to identify Veterans by race and
ethnicity and therefore could produce the data that were required. A VBA White Paper was :
presented to the senior leaders by the Acting VBA Under Secretary, Tom Murphy. Based upon
litigation concerns expressed by Mr. Murphy, the issue was referred back to ACMV for
reconsideration, ACMV’s Chair responded to the Secretary in a letter, dated January 30, 2018, which
confirmed that despite VBA's concerns, the Committee is adamant that its longstanding |
recommendation be implemented. Due to the VA leadership changes, no final decision was
communicated back to the Committee as to VBA’s plans for providing requested data and reports.
Background documentation justifying this recommendation is outlined in the ACMV 2017 Annual ,
Report under Recommendation #1. |
VA Response: Concur in Principle
10 ,
",0,0,0,0
936,"VBA data on race and ethnicity is much more comprehensive than it was 2 years ago; however,
significant data quality issues and voids remain. These issues are particularly challenging for |
Vietnam Era Veterans. A USVETS data file refresh would offer the best near-term action that could
improve the completeness of the information and will be explored. Necessary funding will be |
explored with NCVAS. , !
VBA will continue to assess the availability of demographic data; however, until we are able to obtain |
the missing information, we will be unable to produce a statistically valid report.

Recommendation #3: That the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health |
Administration, follows through on its commitment to provide the VHA Office of Health Equity
(OHE) necessary personnel resources by the end of FY 2019, to facilitate implementation of |
the VA Health Equity Action Plan. :
Rationale: In December 2016, VHA Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Organizational
Excellence assured ACMV that OHE was approved for two additional full-time employees in July :
2016 and that OHE’s mission had her full support. As of June 2017, no additional staffing resources |
have been provided. At the time of the drafting of the 2017 Recommendation #2, VHA was 2
completing the classification process to update the position descriptions prior to starting the :
recruitment action for these positions. However, such actions cannot be initiated since a waiver to |
aflow recruitment under the current hiring process has not been approved. |
In the recent 2016 Commission on Care Report Recommendation #5 — Health Care Equity, the :
Commission recommended: VHA work to eliminate health disparities by establishing health care |
equity.as a strategic priority; VHA provide the OHE adequate resources, levei of authority to
successfully build culture military competence among all VHA Care Systems providers and |
employees; and VHA ensures that the Health Equity Action Plan (HEAP) is fully implemented with ,
adequate staffing, resources and support. The lack of additional staff in OHE has hampered the 2
implementation of HEAP. , |
VA anticipates a smaller, but more diverse Veteran population. VA projects a future overall Veteran :
population in 2043 being 14.5 million, with minority Veterans being 5.2 million, and women Veterans :
11 |
",0,0,0,0
937,"being 2.3 million. Minority Veterans currently comprise approximately 33 percent of the women 2
Veteran population. In 2014, 45.6 percent (2 million) minority Veterans were enrolled in VHA with
approximately 1.3 million using the system and 16.9 percent of those users being service-connected. |
Therefore, with an anticipated minority population in 2043 being 5.2 million, if current trends continue, !
approximately 2.28 million minority Veterans would be enrolled in VA for health care. |
The 2017 Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans Recommendation #2 requested
that the VHA OHE be provided the necessary staffing by the end of FY 2017 to ensure the successful
implementation of HEAP. The Committee is aware of the departure of the Chief Officer, OHE, on |
May 23, 2018, and understand that a job offer has been made to an applicant who will assume this :
role possibly in September 2018. However, there is no indication of current recruitment plans for |
additional OHE staff personnel. It is essential this office be provided adequate resources as soon as |
possible. | ;

Recommendation #4: That the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration, |
develop a comprehensive communication plan to encourage minority Veteran participation in the |
Rapid Appeals Management Process (RAMP) by 2nd Qtr., 2019. 2
Rationale: Minority Veterans have expressed frustration with their benefits claims appeals. Though |
Veterans have received letters from the VA inviting them to participate in RAMP, Veterans did not
fully understand the process and did not have anyone to contact to discuss or receive information on
RAMP. In addition, minority Veterans have reporied that some Veterans Service Officers throughout 2
12
",0,0,0,0
938,"the country are also unclear about the finer points regarding RAMP and are unable to answer their :
Veteran client's questions. As a result of such confusion, minority Veterans have been discouraged |
from participating in RAMP and fewer minority Veterans may be taking advantage of RAMP for fear of |
“re-starting the clock” on their appeals process. A more effective communication strategy that clearly :
delineates the RAMP process will ensure minority Veterans take advantage of this process at levels
commensurate with all Veterans. :
VA Response: Concur in Principle :
RAMP is a voluntary option for eligible Veterans to participate in the new appeals process established
by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 prior to February 2019, the
effective date of the law. Initially, RAMP invitations were mailed to eligible Veterans with some of the
oldest appeals pending by stage. As of April 2018, the requirement to receive a RAMP invitation from
VA has been removed and any Veteran with an eligible appeal may participate in RAMP. :
VBA continues to effectuate a comprehensive communication plan through a combination of ,
mediums, to include in-person briefings at national and state Veteran advocacy group conferences,
web content and social media presence, national press releases, and blast email communications to
Veterans. VBA has worked closely with Congressional stakehoiders, Veterans Service :
Organizations, private attorneys, VA Regional Benefits Office outreach personnel, VBA National Cail ,
Center personnel, and influencer groups to communicate RAMP criteria and eligibility requirements to
Veterans. Information on Appeals Modernization and RAMP can also be found at ,
httos://benefits.va.gov/benefits/appeals.asp. As we will continue our outreach efforts for this ongoing |
initiative as part of normal operations, throughout the RAMP opt-in period which is currently
scheduled to expire in February 2019. !

ACMV hosted a Veterans Town Hall Meeting at the Harris-Stowe State University (HSSU) William L. |

Veterans a forum to share with committee members issues of concer and to obtain answers to |
questions related to VA benefits and services. There were approximately 53 attendees. Local VA :
officials from the VA St. Louis Health Care Center (HCS), St. Louis Regional Benefit Office, and the :
Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery served as panel members during the meeting. Numerous
questions were raised regarding: 1) the disability claims process, 2) the available VA programs on |
addiction and what is VA doing to assist Veterans with addiction, 3) the timeline for adding children — |
especially special needs children ~ Reference Dependent Education Benefit and Survivor Benefits, |
4) and the Choice Program referral process for medical care. Veterans did not understand RAMP |
and expressed the difficulties of getting approved for service-connected benefits. The Veterans ;
expressed the need for VA Representatives from VHA, VBA, and NCA do more outreach and widely :
publicize their outreach events. Also, most Veterans must work during the clinic hours and find it
difficult to take off from work to attend appointments and wanted to know if VA is planning to extend |
or offer services outside of their normal work hours on a limited basis to accommodate these
Veterans —- maybe 1 day per week. VA officials to provide appropriate foliow up on several issues. !

Keith Repko, Director, VA St. Louis Health Care System (HCS): :
e Conducted 60 outreach events this year and at the town hall, talked to a Veteran about :
collaborating on additional outreach events. i
e Looking at expanding their primary care facilities — putting CBOC’s in areas where Veterans
are underserved.

e Inthe future, adding 11 primary care teams. :

-@ Partnering with YMCA’s in the metropolitan area — trying to find ways to make it convenient for ,
the Veterans.

e Continuously improving their partnerships with the local media. :
Darrell Ryan, Assistant Director, Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery: |
e VA must cutreach to the Community Leaders ~ who in turn will connect to their communities.

e We must look at non-traditional methods in putting out media/flyers to inform the Veterans of |
upcoming events: ,

co Target liquor stores ~ have them put your flyers in the windows. i

o Handing out flyers on the street corners.

e The Legacy Program is in the works here at the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery — :
meeting the needs of operating the cemetery comes first. |

e The current program is the Director Program — there are only 15 slots. NCA is small and if you :

Dear Secretary Wilkie,
| am truly honored to serve as the Chairwoman for the Advisory Committee on Minority
Veterans (ACMV), and I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve our Nation's minority
Veterans and their families.
The enclosed 2020 Biennial Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans
(ACMV) includes four recommendations which reflect key issues identified by the
Committee through briefings received at the VA Central Office, a site visit to the VA
facilities in Houston, Texas including a town hall meeting conducted at the United Way of
Greater Houston and recent discussions regarding COVID-19.
The needs of minority Veterans are as diverse as this multicultural population. The
ACMV's 2020 Biennial Report captures some of the most pressing issues affecting
minority Veterans with recommendations focused on the delivery of services to
Veterans in remote areas, data collection, outreach, and delivery of benefits and
services.
2020 marks my fifth year serving on the ACMV and my second year as Chairwoman. The
past five years have afforded me the opportunity to work alongside dedicated Veterans and
the fantastic staff at the Center for Minority Veterans. More importantly, I've had the chance
to witness the VA implement real effective change to enhance the lives of minority Veterans
by implementing previous committee recommendations.
The ACMV is thankful for your leadership, as well as your openness to
implementing new ways to improve the lives of minority Veterans. Thank you for approving
and supporting the 2019 National Minority Veterans Summit as well as the planned 2021
Summit. The Committee is also deeply appreciative of the Center for Minority Veterans for
the tremendous team effort they have put into ensuring the summit was a huge success,
and we also want to thank the VA leadership across the board.
On behalf of the Committee, | express my sincere appreciation for allowing us the privilege
to serve our Nation’s minority Veterans.

Sincerely,

Ly lhull.

The 2020 Biennial Report of the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans (ACMV) provides the
Committee's observations, recommendations and rationales that address the effectiveness of the
Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) delivery of benefits and services to minority Veterans.

The ACMV fulfilled its requirement to conduct a minimum of two meetings during fiscal year (FY)
2019 in accordance with P.L. 103-446, and the VA ACMV charter March 25, 2020. In FY 2020, ACMV
was only able to conduct one of two meetings due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Specifically, ACMV met on December 11-13, 2018, at VA Central Office (VACO) in Washington, DC,
conducted a site visit in Houston, Texas from April 9 to 11, 2019, and met again on December 3-5,
2019, at VA Central Office (VACO). The meetings at VACO, included briefings from the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the National Cemetery
Administration (NCA) and select Staff Offices. Ex Officio members from the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) provided briefings on their respective missions and services provided to
minority Veterans at the VACO meetings. During the Houston site visit, ACMV received briefings and
facility tours at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center (VAMC) Houston Regional Office, and the
Houston National Cemetery. On the afternoon of April 10, 2019, ACMV and representatives from the
Michael E. DeBakey VAMC Houston Regional Office and the Houston National Cemetery responded
to questions from minority Veterans and provided updates on current VA initiatives during a town hall
meeting conducted at the United Way of Greater Houston Community Resource Center.

ACMV reviewed information received during meetings with VA officials through document reviews
and from direct communications with minority Veterans. The Committee strongly believes that if
implemented, the four 2020 recommendations will significantly enhance VA's ability to strategically
address the needs of minority Veterans as the Veterans population become more diverse. These
recommendations and rationales address the following issues:

e Expand the telehealth capabilities to the Compact of Free Association (COFA) Nations, Palau,
the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia to include the required tools and
services to run a successful telehealth system. Timeframe to complete the telehealth system
package is 2 years, by the end of December 2022.

e VHA needs to track and report on the impact of COVID-19 on minority Veterans to identify and
address racial/ethnic health disparities.

e With the Veterans’ Legacy Program, NCA needs to establish a minimum of four working
agreements among institutions that serve the minority Veteran population. NCA should
complete this recommendation by December 31, 2021, with annual reports starting December
31, 2022. NCA should publish results annually starting January 1, 2023.

e Requests that NCA modify four of its application forms to capture race and ethnicity
information. NCA should complete this recommendation by December 31, 2021 with annual
reports starting December 31, 2022. NCA should publish results annually starting January 1,
2023.

978,"Part Il. Summary of 2020 Recommendations
Recommendation #1: That VA expand the telehealth capabilities to the Compact of Free Association
(COFA) Nations, Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia by providing: 1)
the required bandwidth to allow access virtually as some of the islands do not have fiber optic
connections; 2) provide island Veterans with necessary hardware (to include iPads, computers and all
accessories) to access telehealth services; 3) assign health care providers to Veterans through
telehealth; 4) provide and implement an expedited assessment on the possibility of fielding telehealth
soon; 5) provide travel pay to appointments as other Veterans in the U.S. receive this benefit; 6)
provide uniform allowance renewal by teleconference; and 7) conduct semi-Annual Town Hall
meetings for benefits. The time frame to complete the telehealth system package is 2 years, by the
end of December 2022.
Recommendation #2: That VHA track and report on the impact of COVID-19 on minority Veterans.
Specifically identify and address racial/ethnic health disparities and will further categorize the impact
of COVID-19 on minority Veterans by the era served.
Recommendation #3: That VA require the National Cemetery Administration establish a minimum of
four working agreements among institutions that serve the minority Veteran population. NCA should
complete this recommendation by December 31, 2021 with annual reports starting December 31,
2022. NCA should publish results annually starting January 1, 2023.
Recommendation #4: That VA modify the following forms to capture race and ethnicity information
on applications for NCA: VA Form 21P-530, APR 2017 - Application For Burial Benefits; VA Form 40-
1000 - Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial; VA Form 27-2008, June 2018 - Application For
United States Flag For Burial Purposes; and VA Form 21-534EZ - Application For DIC, Survivors,
Pension And/or Accrued Benefits. NCA should complete this recommendation by December 31, 2021
with annual reports starting December 31, 2022. NCA should publish results annually starting
January 1, 2023.

Recommendation #1: That VA expand the telehealth capabilities to the Compact of Free
Association (COFA) Nations, Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of
Micronesia by providing: 1) the required bandwidth to allow access virtually as some of the
islands do not have fiber optic connections; 2) provide island Veterans with necessary

renewal by teleconference; and 7) conduct semi-Annual Town Hall meetings for benefits. The
time frame to complete the telehealth system package is 2 years, by the end of December
2022.
Rationale: Telehealth capabilities would greatly assist the Veterans in obtaining benefits and
services from VA. We feel with the implementation of telehealth system on the islands, VA will be
able to monitor, assist and assess the most needed benefits for the island Veterans.
VA Responses:
VHA Response: Non-Concur
As to expanding the furnishing of VA telehealth services to Veterans in the Freely Associated States
and all the related provisions in Recommendation #1, with few stated exceptions, current law
prohibits VHA practitioners from providing care, including telehealth services, to Veterans outside of a
state. See 38 U.S.C. § 1724, as implemented by 38 C.F.R. § 17.35 and VHA Directive 1601F.05,
“Hospital Care and Medical Services in Foreign Countries.” Current law provides no exceptions for
Veterans located in the Freely Associated States. Thus, inasmuch as this recommendation calls for
the provision of telehealth services, a telehealth package, and telehealth equipment, to this Veteran-
cohort is not legally feasible.
For Recommendation #1.5, “Travel pay to appointments as other Veterans in the U.S. receive this
benefit,” VA could provide beneficiary travel outside a state as hospital care and medical services
under 38 U.S.C. § 1724, but VA’s regulations only authorize beneficiary travel “for travel expenses
incurred in the United States.” See 38 C.F.R. 70.1(a).
VBA Response: Concur-in-Principle — Recommendation #1.7
In reference to semiannual town hall meetings, the Veterans Benefits Administration in collaboration
with the Veterans Health Administration and the U.S. Department of State conducted a virtual town
hall with the U.S. Ambassador to Palau, select embassy staff and representatives from the U.S.
Armed Forces Association of Palau. The town hall was facilitated by the Director of the Manila
Regional Office. Presentations and information were provided on VA Solid Start; the foreign benefits
program; Telehealth, prescription medications and education programs for Veterans, dependents and
survivors; specially adapted housing; general information for Veterans living overseas; and appeals.
Additionally, the Director in Manila was actively engaged with the Department of State to hold a virtual
town hall with Veterans in the Republic of the Marshall Islands and with State Department officials at
the U.S. Embassy in Kolonia, Pohnpei, Federated States of Micronesia which was held on July 20,
2020.

980,"VBA works in conjunction with VHA to conduct semiannual town halls to provide benefits and
eligibility information to these Veterans. The Office of Business Process Integration in coordination
with OI&T can support lines of business involved in this effort with development of any business
systems plans and/or requirements needed to successfully implement this initiative.

NCA Response: NCA does not have any facilities in the Compact of Free Association (COFA)
Nations, Palau, the Marshall Islands or the Federated States of Micronesia. However, NCA will
partner with VBA or VHA to participate in semi-annual town hall meetings for benefits when they are
scheduled.

OIT Response: OIT recommends acknowledgement of the scope of influence over performance of
telehealth technology sponsored and provided by VA and the limitations that exist with national
telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas across the United States. VA OIT will make every
effort to support the provision of information technology dependencies at VA clinics, office space and
other owned or leased location on the provider side of telehealth services.

Recommendation #2: That VA track and report on the impact of COVID-19 on minority
Veterans. Specifically identify and address racial/ethnic health disparities and will further
categorize the impact of COVID-19 on minority Veterans by the era served.

Rationale: Emerging national data, to include VA’s own data, indicate that COVID-19
disproportionately affects minority populations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) provide data that indicate this disproportionality of infection and death among racial and ethnic
minority populations. The VHA COVID-19 Response Plan, Version 1.6, March 23, 2020, has yet to
include data of minority Veterans as being high risk. The categories mentioned are Veterans with
chronic and underlying medical conditions; older Veterans, homeless Veterans; and those who may
have respiratory issues from potential exposure to chemical or environmental factors (Such as burn
pits, etc.). This worldwide pandemic is exposing the significant disparities in health among minority
populations across the United States. Veterans who have served this great Nation are also impacted
and as deaths surpassed 100,000 in late May 2020 across the country, it is imperative that VA
accurately track, monitor and report on the impact of COVID-19 on its most vulnerable Veteran
populations. This data is necessary to undertake strategic level planning, and make informed and
effective responses and strategies to help mitigate the health disparities that COVID-19 has pointedly
illuminated and, in some cases, exacerbated.

Suggested Measurable Actions and Metrics:

e Include minority Veteran data in real time, map-based data on COVID-19 cases in the VA
COVID-19 National Summary, which is tracked by known cases, convalescent cases and
known deaths by state and nationally.

e VHA provide an in-depth report on race and ethnicity of Veterans COVID-19 cases and deaths
per state and nationally to the Center for Minority Veterans and the Advisory Committee on
Minority Veterans on a quarterly basis.

o Include breakout of Veteran COVID-19 cases and deaths by Veteran era (e.g., Vietnam,
Gulf War, etc.).

sensitive manner regarding the risks of COVID-19 on their health.

VA Response: Concur-in-Principle
VHA currently tracks and reports on the impact of COVID-19 on minority Veterans served by VHA to
Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and VAMCs to help them identify and address
racial/ethnic health disparities. We appreciate ACMV’s suggestions that we make this information
available to Veterans and other stakeholders. Information that we make available for some groups of
Veterans may be limited by small population sizes and privacy constraints. As detailed in the Action
Plan, we plan to do the following: add race and ethnicity to the VA COVID-19 National Summary;
develop a quarterly report for CMV on race and ethnicity of Veteran COVID-19 cases and deaths with
breakdowns by military era; add risk factors as they relate to race and ethnicity in the next version of
the COVID-19 Response Plan; develop more intense and deliberate messaging to minority Veteran
populations in a culturally sensitive manner regarding the risks of COVID-19 on their health.

Recommendation #3: That VA require the National Cemetery Administration establish a
minimum of four working agreements among institutions that serve the minority Veteran
population. NCA should complete this recommendation by December 31, 2021 with annual
reports starting December 31, 2022. NCA should publish results annually starting January 1,
2023.
Rationale: The NCA Veterans Legacy Research and Engagement has implemented an interactive
web site with public digital engagement for Veteran memorialization. The partnership would establish
a minority interactive memorial and increase access focus on the minority Veteran stories.
Specifically, we recommend that NCA enhance the Veterans Legacy Program by developing and
implementing working group agreements among Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU),
Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI), Native American Serving Institutions (NASI), Asian American and
Pacific Islanders Serving Institutions (AAPISI) and other institutions that have historically served our
minority Veterans. The focus of these partnerships is to enhance and expand the capacity to better
serve minority Veterans within the Veterans Legacy Program.
VA Response: Concur-in-Principle
The mission of the Veterans Legacy Program (VLP) is to memorialize Veterans interred in NCA
cemeteries through educational outreach. To that end, VLP has executed its mission successfully,
which includes actively producing educational outreach materials that celebrate the service and
sacrifice of the fullest diversity of the Veterans community. Examples of this can be found on NCA’s
Page 10 of 44
",0,0,0,0
983,"Internet Web site under the History, Education and Legacy TAB. NCA has performed outreach to
various institutions that serve the minority Veteran population.
Annually, the NCA VLP posts public solicitations for institutions and non-profit organizations to submit
proposals to share our mission via a contract, wholly in accordance with the Federal Acquisition
Regulations (FAR). The FAR specifically prohibits us from targeting specific institutions or vendors for
contract award. The Office of Engagement and Memorial Innovation (OEMI) and VLP staff work to
build awareness amongst all instructions of higher learning of VLP contract solicitations, including in-
person visits to HBCUs such as Howard University. To date, HSIs and AAPISIs have applied (as
noted below), but no HBCUs. NCA is not able to control who submits proposals or to target specific
groups to respond to a public solicitation. NCA regularly reports to the Advisory Committee on
Cemeteries and Memorials (ACCM) on outreach efforts to institutions of higher learning through VLP.
NCA further reports to ACCM on outreach efforts to minority and underserved communities.
During FY 2020, VLP has awarded contracts with institutions in the following categories:
e AAPISI: San Francisco State University and University of Hawaii-Manoa.
e HSI: Texas A&M University; University of California-Riverside and San Francisco State
University.
While NCA does not currently have any working group agreements with any specific NASIs, NCA is a
member of a consortium with the National Museum of the American Indian (Smithsonian) and the
National Indian Education Association that is creating educational outreach materials in support of the
dedication of the National Native American Veterans Memorial.
All the products created by other institutions that work with VLP have memorialized the service
of Veterans from diverse backgrounds. Information on VLP can be found at
https://www.cem.va.gov/legacy/.
Expanding engagement with minority communities is in the long-term interests of NCA. For example,
the Public Affairs and Outreach Team has been collaborating with other program offices in NCA to
expand NCA’s tribal outreach. NCA regularly participates with other offices in VA (e.g., the Office of
Tribal Government Relations, the Center for Minority Veterans and the Office of Rural Health) toward
accomplishing this goal.
OEMI’s Public Affairs staff regularly publishes social media content telling the story of minority
Veterans. All of the social media posts can be found by the public on Facebook and Twitter. Social
media content is often pulled from VLP for social media posts or the content is developed by NCA
historians working with the public affairs team. (e.g., NCA has profiled the stories on stories
associated with Navajo Code Talkers, Buffalo Soldiers and other Veterans).
Last year, NCA released the Veterans Legacy Memorial (VLM), which is an online memorial space.
VLM serves as a portal to celebrate and remember those Veterans interred VA’s national cemeteries.
Recently, NCA enhanced the capability of the VLM platform with the capability of allowing families
and friends to leave tributes to Veterans. An example of such tribute can be found at the following
link: https:/Awww.vim.cem.va.gov/1234/ROBERTEUGENEGARTZKE/011B2A2/.
Since NCA has four working agreements with institutions that serve the minority Veteran population
through FY20 and 21, NCA suggests closure of this recommendation.

Recommendation #4: That VA modify the following forms to capture race and ethnicity
information on applications for NCA: VA Form 21P-530, APR 2017 - Application For Burial
Benefits; VA Form 40-1000 - Pre-Need Determination of Eligibility for Burial; VA Form 27-2008,
June 2018 - Application For United States Flag For Burial Purposes; and VA Form 21-534EZ -
Application For DIC, Survivors, Pension And/or Accrued Benefits. NCA should complete this
recommendation by December 31, 2021 with annual reports starting December 31, 2022. NCA
should publish results annually starting January 1, 2023.
Rationale: We understand that NCA is in the process of updating forms to facilitate Veterans' access
to NCA services and to more accurately account for Veterans’ race and ethnicity.
VA Responses:
NCA Response: NCA has modified VA Form 40-10007, Pre-Need Determination for Burial to capture
race and ethnicity information. We provide a link to the updated form that is publicly available on the
following VA.gov website: hitps://www.va.gov/find-forms/?qg=pre-need. No Action Plan is needed for
this completed item.
NCA does not manage the three other forms noted in Recommendation #4. As such, we defer to VBA
to address form updates or to provide an Action Plan for the following: VA Form 21P-530, APR 2017 -
Application for Burial Benefits; VA Form 27-2008, June 2018 - Application For United States Flag For
Burial Purposes; and VA Form 21-534EZ - Application For DIC, Survivors, Pension And/or Accrued

VBA Response: Non-Concur
The potential risk in VA collecting this data is not outweighed by the overall benefits of the data
collection. More specifically, VBA is concerned that capturing race and ethnicity data may result in
an increase of an incorrect use of this data by Veterans as a rationale for appealing or disputing a
less-than-favorable disability rating. As such, the collection of this data would be best performed in
a manner that is distinctly separate from the development and adjudication of Veteran and
beneficiaries’ claims for benefits.

ACMV hosted a Veterans town hall meeting at the United Way of Greater Houston Community
Resource Center. The meeting provided Veterans a forum to share issues of concern and to obtain
answers to questions from ACMV members related to VA benefits and services. There were
approximately 100 attendees. Local VA officials from the Michael E. DeBakey VAMC Houston
Regional Office and the Houston National Cemetery served as panel members during the meeting.
Numerous questions were raised regarding the following issues: the difficulties of getting
appointments and the long wait times for appointments; the need for peer support groups for both the
Veterans and families; and the Veterans expressed the need for VA Representatives from VHA, VBA
and NCA do more outreach and widely publicize their outreach events. During the town hall, the
ACMV heard from Veterans who had great experiences with VA.

e The Regional Office is surveying their customers and negative feedback is not showing up in

Dr. Jagadeesh Kalavar, Acting Director, Michael E. DeBakey VAMC:
e Minority contract companies are given priority — need a leaner contracting process because
you are competing with the private sector.
e Have an active Peer Support Therapy Group.
e The Committee recommended that VAMC offer the Veterans a Peer Support Group more on a
social level, so the Veterans can talk to each other than in a therapy session.
e Conduct monthly townhall meetings and attend additional townhall meetings with other
organizations monthly.

1003,"Recommendation #4: That the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Benefits Administration,
develop a comprehensive communication plan to encourage minority Veteran participation in the
Rapid Appeals Management Process (RAMP) by 2nd Qtr., 2019.
VA Response: Concur-in-Principle
The Rapid Appeals Modernization Program (RAMP) was a voluntary option for eligible Veterans to
participate in the new decision review process established by the Veterans Appeals Improvement and
Modernization Act of 2017 (AMA) that took effect on February 19, 2019. It provided eligible Veterans
with early resolutions to their currently appealed claims.
Throughout the lifecycle of RAMP, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) ensured Veterans
were aware of the opportunity through various forms of robust communication. VA distributed a suite
of Veteran-centric engagement and communication materials to inform Veterans, their families,
Veterans Service Organizations (VSO), and other stakeholders, of the benefits of RAMP. VBA
created a YouTube video, and hosted a Facebook Live event for all 540,000 followers, responding
directly to questions, and distributed an informational RAMP video link through social media platforms
(Facebook, Twitter). Additionally, VBA worked extensively with accredited representatives and other
stakeholders to provide information on RAMP and Appeals Modernization at various outreach events.
VBA supported several VSO presentations, to include the National Association of County Veterans
Service Officers, bi-annual VSO/Military Service Organization summit, biweekly national VSO
meetings, VSO Communication Directors, as well as various VSO conferences. VBA conducted Town
Halls at various Regional Offices, hosted congressional presentations, and provided scripts for
National Call Center employees.
VBA discontinued RAMP on February 14, 2019, with full implementation of the AMA. AMA offers
Veterans a greater choice in how VA reviews their claim. As of February 19, 2019, Veterans who
disagree with a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) decision have three decision review choices:
Higher-Level Review, Supplemental Claim, and an appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. To
increase awareness of AMA, VBA continues to maintain and expand its presence on social media
and blog sites delivering AMA related messaging. VBA has updated internal websites to deliver
information regarding AMA and provide detailed information regarding the decision review process.
Additionally, VBA is also delivering its messaging through other media outlets with public service
announcements (PSA). VBA sought diversity and inclusion when casting Veterans for the AMA PSA.
VBA continues to work closely with Congressional stakeholders, Veterans Service Organizations,
private attorneys, VA Regional Benefits Office outreach personnel, VBA National Call Center
personnel, and influencer groups to communicate AMA criteria and eligibility requirements to
Veterans.

VBA Response: Concur
Recently, within the last 60 days, the Benefits Assistance Service (BAS) conducted US Census data
research related to areas of the country with high Hispanic populations. The research showed the VA
regional offices (VAROs) with jurisdiction over those “high” Hispanic population areas were the Waco
and Houston ROs, the San Diego, Oakland, and San Francisco ROs, the New York RO, the Chicago
RO, and the Phoenix RO. (Please note the San Juan VARO website is already translated into
Spanish hitp://www.benefits.va.gov/sanjuansp/index-sp.asp). In addition to researching Census data,
BAS also reviewed the Annual Benefits Report (ABR) to research and consider benefit recipients’
demographic information. Now that this research is complete, the next step is to submit the data from
the VAROs within the high Hispanic population areas for translations. BAS will be turning over the
web content of these VAROs to translators within the next 30 days as part of its Translation Services
contract. It is expected that the translated web pages will be built by the end of this fiscal year.
Additionally, BAS is in the planning stages of translating the Transition Assistance Program (TAP)
Participant User Guides. The TAP program is currently undergoing a redesign, which will be
completed in 2018. Upon completion of this redesign, the Participant User Guide will also be
translated. Finally, as indicated below, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Benefits for
Veterans, Dependents and Survivors publication is prepared each year and has not been translated
into Spanish since 2013. The following link directs you to the latest Spanish language version:
https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/benefits_book/2013 Federal Benefits for Veterans Spanish.pd
f. BAS will begin working with OPIA to translate this online version of the Federal Benefits Booklet
and will work to have it translated into Spanish in 2018.
Update July 2020: VBA has made efforts to ensure Spanish language materials are available to
Veterans and their beneficiaries. VBA created Spanish versions to the regional office home
webpages for Los Angeles, Oakland, Houston, Waco and created a Spanish language resource
webpage. Additionally, VBA has online factsheets, pamphlets and brochures. VA’s Office of Public
and Intergovernmental Affairs is currently working with VBA’s Office of Strategic Engagement to
have the online version of the 2020 Federal Benefits Booklets translated into Spanish.
Important Note: In the response for Recommendation #4, VBA has a correction that should be
included in the update. VBA does not have a regional office in San Francisco, so it should be
omitted from the report.
In the 2017 report, there was a recommendation to update TAP to accommodate Spanish
speaking participants by providing a Spanish version of the VA Benefits and Services participant
guide. This recommendation has been completed and the first Spanish version of the VA Benefits
and Services participant guide was published in January 2018.

1008,"In reference to the websites, as of the beginning of FY18, VA began migrating benefits contents from
benefits.va.gov websites to VA.gov, using a new content management system. With these changes,
OSE began working with VA with the possibility of translating these contents into Spanish (by March
of 2019). Some efforts have been initiated and conducted, to include user interface testing,
researching for the most suitable translation platform or methods, research of ideas from other
government agencies’ translated contents, user testing with Veterans and their family members, and
determining the feasibility of contractual elements (budget).
The translation project had been put on hold due to lack of funding, VA.gov contracting changeover
and constraints, and more recently, refocusing of efforts in implementing COVID-19 web resources.
Additionally, RO websites (listed in the table below) are now available in Spanish. Additional pages
are being completed as resources allow.
Fact Sheets
In addition, 60% of benefits fact sheets have been translated into Spanish. These were the most used
fact sheets and were deemed suitable for translation.
VA Federal Benefits Booklet for Veterans, Dependents, and Survivors
The 2020 edition of the booklet is 76 pages long, including the front and back covers.
lt has been assigned to a contractor and is pending review of the proof. After approval, it will be ready
to print (both physical and electronic forms). The electronic version of the booklet will then be
translated into Spanish. The translation process and web updates will take approximately 3-4 weeks.
VA Transition Assistance Program (TAP) Benefits and Services Participant Guides
TAP Participant Guides have been translated into Spanish, in December of 2017. New versions of the
Guide will continue to be translated into Spanish.
